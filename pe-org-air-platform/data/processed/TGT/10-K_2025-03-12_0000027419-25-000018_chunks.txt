Gross Margin (GM) Rate
Our gross margin rate was 28.2 percent in 2024 and 27.5 percent in 2023. The increase reflected the net impact of 
•
merchandising activities, including cost improvements which more than offset higher promotional and clearance markdown rates, as well as growth in advertising and marketplace revenues;
•
lower book to
 
physical inventory adjustments in 2024; and
•
higher supply chain & digital fulfillment costs due to new supply chain facilities coming online and an increase in digital volume.
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense Rate
Our SG&A expense rate was 20.6 percent in 2024, compared with 20.0 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of cost increases across our business, including higher team member pay and benefits and higher general liability expenses, partially offset by the benefit of lower store remodel-related expenses.

s. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Capital Expenditures
Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.
Capital expenditures in 2024 reflect investments in our strategic initiatives, including investments in both stores and in our supply chain, enhancing our capabilities and guest experience across stores and digital channels. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2024 compared with 2023 primarily reflects a slowdown in store remodel activities.
We expect capital expenditures in 2025 of approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, with the majority focused on store assets, including both new stores and remodels, as well as continued investment in supply chain and technology projects. We expect to open about 20 new stores during 2025 and to resume a faster pace of remodel activities compared with 2024. 
Dividends
We paid dividends totaling $2.0 billion ($4.44 per share) in 2024 and $2.0 billion ($4.36 per share) in 2023, a per share increase of 1.8 percent. We declared dividends totaling $2.1 billion ($4.46 per share) in 2024 and $2.1 billion ($4.38 per share) in 2023, a per share increase of 1.8 percent. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.
Share Repurchases
During 2024, we deployed $1.0 billion to repurchase shares. We did not repurchase any shares during 2023. See

term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facilities also contain a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, as of February 1, 2025, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.

Future Cash Requirements
We enter into contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business that may require future cash payments. Such obligations include, but are not limited to, purchase commitments, debt service, leasing arrangements, and liabilities related to deferred compensation and pensions. The

Note 8

Vendor income:
    We receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, promotions, advertising allowances, and markdown allowances. Vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales except in arrangements where the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs and recorded as an offset to those costs. Vendor income earned can vary based on a number of factors, including purchase volumes, sales volumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.
We establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on historical trending and data, this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $543 million and $513 million as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectively. Vendor income is described further in

Income taxes:
    We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is more likely than not the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Gross uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $454 million and $366 million as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectively. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the resolution of these matters could be materially different from our assumptions, which would affect our consolidated results of operations and/or operating cash flows. Income taxes are described further in

We do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods.

floating rate interest rate swaps, compared to our floating rate short-term investments. As of February 1, 2025, our floating rate short-term investments exceeded our floating rate debt obligations by approximately $1.7 billion. Based on our financial position as of February 1, 2025, the annualized effect of a 1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate short-term investments, net of our floating rate debt obligations, would increase our earnings before income taxes by $17 million. In general, we expect our floating rate debt obligations to be in line with our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate and economic environments.

We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position as of February 1, 2025, the annualized effect of a 1 percentage point increase/(decrease) in interest rates would increase/(decrease) earnings before income taxes by $17 million.
In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expen

Report of Management on the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the consistency, integrity, and presentation of the information in the Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include necessary judgments and estimates by management.
To fulfill our responsibility, we maintain comprehensive systems of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with established procedures. The concept of reasonable assurance is based upon recognition that the cost of the controls should not exceed the benefit derived. We believe our systems of internal control provide this reasonable assurance.
The Board of Directors exercised its oversight role with respect to the Corporation's systems of internal control primarily through its Audit & Risk Committee, which is comprised of independent directors. The Committee oversees the Corporation's systems of internal control, accounting practices, financial reporting and au
