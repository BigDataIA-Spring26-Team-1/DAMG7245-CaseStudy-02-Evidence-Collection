Gross Margin (GM) Rate
Our gross margin rate was 28.2 percent in 2024 and 27.5 percent in 2023. The increase reflected the net impact of 
•
merchandising activities, including cost improvements which more than offset higher promotional and clearance markdown rates, as well as growth in advertising and marketplace revenues;
•
lower book to

physical inventory adjustments in 2024; and
•
higher supply chain & digital fulfillment costs due to new supply chain facilities coming online and an increase in digital volume.
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense Rate
Our SG&A expense rate was 20.6 percent in 2024, compared with 20.0 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of cost increases across our business, including higher team member pay and benefits and higher general liability expenses, partially offset by the benefit of lower store remodel-related expenses.

Other Performance Factors
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense was $411 million for 2024, compared with $502 million for 2023. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in interest income.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.2 percent compared with 21.9 percent in 2023. The increase primarily reflects lower discrete tax benefits compared to the prior year.
Numerous countries, including certain jurisdictions in which we operate, have enacted legislation to implement the model rules of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Pillar Two framework (Pillar Two), which is designed to ensure large multinational enterprises are subject to a 15 percent global minimum tax on income earned in each jurisdiction in which they operate. We do not expect the enacted rules, which will be applicable to us in 2025, to materially impact our 2025 financial results. 
Under the Pillar Two framework, any existing deferred tax assets not disclosed in our financial statements will not be available for future use. Accordingly, we are disclosing the existence of gro

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Index to Financial Statements
We have also disclosed after-tax ROIC, which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of the add-back of operating lease interest to operating income. We believe this metric is useful in assessing the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.
