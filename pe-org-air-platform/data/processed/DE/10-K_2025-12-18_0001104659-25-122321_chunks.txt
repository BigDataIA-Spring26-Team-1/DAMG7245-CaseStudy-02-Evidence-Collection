Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions
Our Smart Industrial Operating Model aims to deliver greater value for our customers, accelerate our competitive advantage in advanced technologies, build on our fundamental manufacturing strengths and core values, and capitalize on opportunities that lie ahead by leveraging advanced technologies with our operational excellence. To drive these outcomes, we are focused on the following three pillars: 
Production Systems
. A strategic alignment of products and solutions around our customers’ production systems. Production systems refer to the series of steps our customers take to execute different tasks, operations, and projects to grow an agricultural product or execute a project. 
Technology Stack
. Investments in technology, as well as research and development, which deliver intelligent solutions to our customers through hardware and devices, embedded software, connectivity, data platforms, and applications. The technology stack leverages these core technologies across the enterprise, including digital capabilities, automation and machine learning, and autonomy. The stack has the potential to unlock economic and sustainable value for customers by optimizing jobs, strengthening decision-making, and better connecting the steps of a production system. 
Lifecycle Solutions
. The enterprise integration of our aftermarket and support capabilities to more effectively manage customer equipment, service, and techno

Equipment Operations
Our equipment operations consist of three of our business segments: PPA, SAT, and CF. In fiscal year 2025, PPA generated $17,311 net sales, or 45% of equipment operations net sales; SAT generated $10,224 net sales, or 26% of equipment operations net sales; and CF generated $11,382 net sales, or 29% of equipment operations net sales. 
Production & Precision Agriculture 
The PPA segment is committed to meeting the fundamental needs of our customers through a combination of equipment and technology designed to enable our customers to overcome some of their biggest challenges: doing more with less, labor shortages, volatile input costs, and executing jobs in tighter timeframes. This segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions for production-scale growers of crops like large grains (such as corn and soy), small grains (such as wheat, oats, and barley), cotton, and sugarcane. Equipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes four-wheel-drive (4WD)/track and row crop tractors, harvesters, cotton pickers, cotton strippers, sugarcane harvesters, sugarcane loaders, and related harvesting front-end equipment. In addition, the segment includes tillage, seeding, and application equipment, including sprayers and nutrient management, and soil preparation machinery, and related attachments and service parts.
We continue to invest in the development and production of advanced technology through integrated agricultural sol

Small Agriculture & Turf 
SAT is committed to meeting the needs of our customers through defining, developing, and delivering global equipment and technology solutions for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop and small acre crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment works to provide product leadership while extending integrated agricultural solutions and precision technologies across its portfolio of equipment. 
Equipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes specialty, utility, and compact tractors, hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers, and mowers; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment, commercial mowing equipment, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating, and other residential, commercial, golf, and sports turf care applications; and related attachments and service parts.
SAT equipment is sold primarily through independent retail dealer networks, although the segment also builds turf products for sale by mass retailers, including The Home Depot and Lowe’s. Our turf equipment is sold primarily in North American, Western European, and Australian markets.
In the small agriculture market, we are developing autonomous solutions, connectivity capabilities, and a path to electrifying our future by deli

Business Environment
. Sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm commodity and protein prices, world grain stocks, acreage available and planted, crop yields, soil conditions, farm input costs, government policies, including global trade policies, and the amount and timing of government support. Sales also are influenced by general economic conditions, farmland prices, farmers’ debt levels and access to financing, interest and exchange rates, labor availability and costs, energy costs and related policies, tax policies, policies related to climate change, and other input costs associated with farming. Other key factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value, age, and level of used equipment, including tractors, harvesting equipment, self-propelled sprayers, hay and forage equipment, and seeding equipment. Weather and climatic conditions also can affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers.

We believe innovations in machinery and technology may influence purchases of agricultural equipment, especially when the agricultural environment is challenging. For example, larger, more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations to increase profits. Large, cost-efficient, highly mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output. These customers are increasingly adopting and integrating precision agricultural technologies like guidance, telematics, automation, and data-driven management in their operations. The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to us. A large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in many countries outside the U.S. and Canada, are comprised of (1) tractors over 100 horsepower, (2) self-propelled combines, cotton pickers, forage harvesters, and sprayers, and (3) seeding equipment. 
Agricultural trends, including the production of and demand for renewable fuels, including biofuels, can also impact sales. This growing demand has led to a corresponding increase in the need for agriculturally based feedstocks used in their production, such as corn in the U.S. and Europe and sugar cane in Brazil. This increased demand may increase the demand for agricultural equipment to be used in the production of such crops. In addition,

Construction & Forestry 
Our CF segment is committed to meeting the need for smart and more sustainable solutions to help our customers meet industry challenges, including jobsite safety, a shortage of skilled labor, volatile input costs, reducing rework, maximizing uptime, and minimizing their environmental footprint. 
To address these challenges, we have delivered a portfolio of construction, roadbuilding, and forestry products with precision technology solutions. Our smart solutions such as SmartWeigh™, Smart Grade™, machine and system automation, and the John Deere Operations Center™, are designed to allow customers to complete more functions with fewer inputs, reduce rework and guesswork, and transform data into insights to allow for better decisions. 
Obstacle detection solutions such as SmartDetect™

supplement operator visibility on the jobsite through a combination of cameras, radar, and machine learning. 
Additionally, we plan to deliver hybrid-electric and battery electric equipment solutions to help customers reduce tailpipe emissions without sacrificing power and performance. 
In addition to creating solutions for the challenges mentioned above, our CF training team is providing comprehensive sales, technical, parts, and operator training for dealers and customers so that the features and technologies of our solutions are understood and utilized with the goal of maximizing customer productivity, jobsite safety, and uptime.
