Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
On January 15, 2025, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), along with the Attorneys General of the States of Illinois and Minnesota, filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Western Division. The Attorneys General of the States of Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin then joined the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges monopolization and unfair competition in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction and other equitable relief to allow owners of our equipment, as well as independent repair providers, access to our repair tools and any other repair resources available to authorized John Deere dealers. On March 17, 2025, we filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, the FTC filed a response on April 28, 2025, and we filed a reply on May 28, 2025. A hearing was held on the motion to dismiss and the court denied the motion. We are in preliminary discussions with the FTC with respect to a potential resolution. At this stage we are unable to predict the outcome or impact of this matter on our business.
In addition to the above, the most prevalent legal claims relate to product liability (including asbestos-related liability), employment, patent, trademark, and antitrust matters (including class action litigation).

Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 27, 2024, except as set forth below:
Legal proceedings, disputes and government inquiries and investigations could harm our business, financial condition, reputation, and brand.
We routinely are a party to claims and legal actions and the subject of government inquiries and investigations, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos-related liability), antitrust matters (including class action litigation), employment, patent, and trademark. For example, we were recently the subject of a previously disclosed Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation into our information security practices and statements, which was closed by the FTC without action. The defense of lawsuits and government inquiries and investigations has resulted and may result in expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations. Adverse decisions in one or more of these claims, actions, inquiries, or investigations could require us to pay substantial damages or fines, undertake service actions, initiate recall campaigns, or take other costly actions. It is therefore possible that legal judgments or investigations could give rise to expenses that are not covered, or not fully covered, by our insurance programs and could affect our financial position and results.
We are currently subject to a consolidated multidistric
