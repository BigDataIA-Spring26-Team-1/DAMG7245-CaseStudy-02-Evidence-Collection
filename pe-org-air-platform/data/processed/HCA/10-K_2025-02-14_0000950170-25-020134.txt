Item 1A. Risk Factors
 
If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect us. Our business is subject to the following material risks and uncertainties.
 
 
Risks related to our indebtedness:
 
We have significant indebtedness and may incur further indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.
 
As of December 31, 2024, our total indebtedness was $43.031 billion. As of December 31, 2024, we had availability of $3.486 billion under our senior secured cash flow credit facility and $4.500 billion under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving effect to letters of credit and borrowing base limitations. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:
 
•
increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations; 
•
requiring a portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; 
•
exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates on our existing borrowings that are at variable rates of interest or refinancing our debt in a rising or high rate environment; 
•
limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures; 
•
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, product or service line development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and 
•
limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt. 
We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, interest rates and the related risks that we now face could intensify.
 
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.
 
Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot guarantee we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.
 
In addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions
 

32

 
to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.
 
We may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, the terms of which may not be favorable to us. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the then current global economic and financial conditions which affect the availability of debt financing and the rates at which such financing is available. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors.
 
If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.
 
Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.
 
Our senior secured credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:
 
•
incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; 
•
pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; 
•
make certain investments; 
•
sell or transfer assets; 
•
create liens; 
•
consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and 
•
enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. 
Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, borrowing availability is subject to a borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable less customary reserves, with any reduction in the borrowing base that results in the borrowing base falling below the amount committed by the lenders thereunder commensurately reducing our ability to access this facility as a source of liquidity. In addition, under the asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility and the revolving facility under our senior secured cash flow credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.
 
Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios may be affected by global economic and financial conditions or other events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet those ratios. A breach of this or any other covenant could result in a default under both the cash flow credit facility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under these senior secured credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, which would also result in an event of default under a significant portion of our other outstanding indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets under our senior secured credit facilities. If any of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance there will be sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities and our other indebtedness.

Risks related to human capital:
 
Our results of operations may be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and other health care professionals and labor union activity.
 
Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical personnel, such as physicians, nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals and other facilities, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. We depend on the available labor pool of employees in each of the markets in which we operate to fill other necessary positions. In some markets, the availability of nonphysician health care professionals and medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to health care providers, including at certain of our facilities. The impact of labor shortages across the health care industry may result in other health care facilities, such as nursing homes, limiting admissions, which may constrain our ability to discharge patients to such facilities, increase labor costs and further exacerbate the demand on our resources, supplies and staffing.
Economic conditions, including macroeconomic uncertainties and inflationary pressure, workforce burnout, and public health conditions have exacerbated workforce competition, personnel shortages and capacity constraints. We may be required to increase wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel and to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel.
 
If there is additional union organizing activity or a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase. When negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, we have experienced, and could experience in the future, labor strikes. Our continued operation during any strikes could result in an increase to our labor costs. In addition, upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, we may not reach new agreements without union action, and any such new agreements may not be on terms satisfactory to us. The unavailability of staff, or the inability of the Company to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our capacity, growth prospects and results of operations.
In addition, federal and state laws and regulations may increase our costs of maintaining qualified nurses and other medical support personnel. We operate in states that have adopted mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or mandate staffing committees to develop staffing plans. If these states reduce, or if additional states in which we operate adopt or the federal government adopts, mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or related measures, our compliance with such measures could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues or our results of operations if we are required to limit admissions, hire additional personnel or otherwise incur additional costs. If our labor costs continue to increase, we may not be able to offset these increased costs, as a significant percentage of our revenues are based on reimbursement rates that are fixed or negotiated no less frequently than annually.
Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.
 
The success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admission and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to their employment or affiliation with our hospitals. Although we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and instead affiliate with us and use our facilities as an extension of their practices. In many of the markets we serve, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. We continue to face increasing competition to recruit and retain quality physicians, as well as increasing costs to contract with hospital-based physicians. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. If states enact legal restrictions on the provision of medical care, such restrictions may impact providers' recruitment and retention efforts in certain states. We anticipate facing increased challenges in this area as the physician population reaches retirement age, especially if there is a shortage of physicians willing and able to provide comparable services. If we are unable to recruit and retain quality physicians to affiliate with our hospitals, enter into contractual arrangements with hospital-based physicians, or provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, our admissions may decrease, our operating performance may decline, and our capacity and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.
 
 
We may be unable to attract, hire and retain a highly qualified workforce, including key management.
 
The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. The members of our management team have significant industry experience, and if any member leaves the Company, such member would be difficult to replace. While we have adopted succession plans to prepare for such an event, our succession plans may not result in a successful transition. Further, institutional knowledge may be lost in any potential managerial transition. We may be unable to retain key management or attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do
 

34

 
not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified employee talent or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success.
Risks related to technology, data privacy and cybersecurity:
 
Cybersecurity incidents or other forms of data breaches could result in the compromise of our facilities, confidential data or critical data systems, causing our operations to be impaired or impacted. A cybersecurity incident or other form of data breach could also give rise to potential harm to patients; remediation and other expenses; and exposure to liability under privacy and security laws, consumer protection laws, common law theories or other laws. Such incidents could subject us to litigation and foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.
 
We, directly and through our vendors and other third parties, collect and store on our networks and devices and third-party technology platforms sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, protected health information of our patients and personally identifiable information of our employees, patients and consumers. Our facilities use EHRs and medical devices that store or transmit information that are integral to the provision of patient care, and these systems and devices are increasingly connected to the internet, hospital networks and other medical devices. The secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations.
 
We have implemented multiple layers of security measures, including cybersecurity and information security systems, protocols and monitoring procedures, intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. In addition, we rely on various third parties to have appropriate controls to protect our information that is on their systems or otherwise in their control, and we seek to obtain assurances that such third parties will protect our information. However, despite our efforts to mitigate our exposure to cyberattack, even an advanced internal control environment is vulnerable to compromise. We have seen, and believe we will continue to see, widespread vulnerabilities that could affect our or other third parties’ data or systems. We rely on a substantial number of employees, contractors, personnel, hardware, software, applications, and third-party vendors, platforms and technologies, each of which may represent an attack surface for threat actors. Threats from malicious threat actors, including nation-state actors and ransomware groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against our, or our vendors’, information systems and devices create risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, malware and phishing incidents, in which third parties attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or our vendors’ employees into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can in turn be used for unauthorized access to our or our vendors’ systems. We, our vendors and other third parties have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and continue to be the target of attempted cybersecurity and other threats that could have a significant impact on our business, including threats by third parties seeking to access, misappropriate, corrupt, or manipulate our information or disrupt our operations. We expect that we, our vendors and other third parties will continue to experience an increase in cybersecurity threats in the future, both directly and indirectly through threats targeting third parties, as the volume and intensity of cyberattacks on hospitals, health systems and other health care entities continue to increase. 
Furthermore, because the tools and techniques used by attackers change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We, our vendors and other third parties may experience security incidents that may remain undetected for an extended period. Even if identified, we, our vendors and other third parties may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches, including due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. 
State-sponsored threat actors are increasingly targeting critical infrastructure sectors, including health systems and other critical infrastructure on which we rely. Increasing use of AI technologies in our internal systems may create new attack surfaces or methods for threat actors, and threat actors may use AI technologies to make cyberattacks more difficult to detect, contain or mitigate. Internal access management failures could also result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture, or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise cybersecurity or information security. There can be no assurance that we or our vendors and other third parties will not be subject to additional cybersecurity threats and incidents that bypass our or their security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our or their information systems, devices or business, including our ability to provide various health care services. In such an event, we may incur substantial costs, including but not limited to, costs associated with remediating the effects of the cybersecurity or information security incident, costs for security measures to guard against similar future incidents and costs to recover data. Further, consumer confidence in the integrity and security of personal information and critical operations data in the health care industry generally could be shaken to the extent there are successful cyberattacks at other health care services companies, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.
 

35

 
Cybersecurity, privacy, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our facilities, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, along with their increased volume and sophistication, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities or incidents, and such measures may decrease the efficiency of our operations. We may also be required to expend additional resources to comply with evolving federal and state requirements related to cybersecurity and information security, including those focused on health care providers. Although, to date, no cyberattack or other information or security breach has resulted in material losses or other material consequences to us, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures in place to monitor and mitigate the risks of cyber threats, including the remediation of critical cybersecurity, information security and software vulnerabilities, will be sufficient and/or timely and that we will not suffer material losses or consequences in the future. Additionally, while we have in place insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover our losses in excess of what we self-insure, or all types of claims that may arise. The occurrence of any of these events could result in (i) harm to patients; (ii) business interruptions and delays; (iii) the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; (iv) litigation and potential liability under privacy, security, breach notification and consumer protection laws, common law theories or other applicable laws; (v) reputational damage; and (vi) foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.
 
Our operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.
 
The performance of our information systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including:
 
•
accounting and financial reporting; 
•
billing and collecting accounts; 
•
coding and compliance;
•
admissions, provision of care and care coordination;
•
clinical systems and medical devices; 
•
medical records and document storage; 
•
inventory management; 
•
negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts; and 
•
monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality measures necessary for full Medicare payment updates. 
Information systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts such as inadvertent or intentional misuse by employees, natural disasters and cyberattacks, including ransomware and data theft. Moreover, we rely on various third-party technology platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope. Failure to adequately and timely manage implementations of new technology, updates or enhancements of such platforms or interfaces between platforms could place us at a competitive disadvantage, disrupt our operations, and have a material, adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
We have taken precautionary measures designed to prevent problems that could affect our information systems. Nevertheless, we or our vendors and other third parties that we rely upon may experience system failures and disruptions. The occurrence of any system failure could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of systems, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.
 
Health care technology initiatives, particularly those related to sharing patient data and interoperability and AI, involve risks that may adversely affect our operations.
 
The federal government is working to promote the adoption of health information technology and the promotion of nationwide health information exchange to improve health care. For example, HHS incentivizes the adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR technology through its Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and Quality Payment Program. Eligible hospitals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology and have not applied and qualified for a hardship exception are subject to reduced reimbursement from Medicare. Eligible health care professionals are also subject to positive or negative payment adjustments based, in part, on their use of EHR technology. Therefore, if our hospitals and employed professionals are unable to properly adopt, maintain and utilize certified EHR
 

36

 
systems, we could be subject to penalties that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
As EHR technologies have become widespread, the federal government has increased its focus on promoting patient access to health care data and interoperability. The 21st Century Cures Act and its implementing regulations prohibit information blocking by health care providers and certain other entities. Information blocking is defined as engaging in activities likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Under a rule finalized by HHS in July 2024, a hospital found to have engaged in information blocking will not qualify as a “meaningful electronic health record user” under the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and as a result will lose 75% of the annual market basket increase it would otherwise receive, and MIPS-eligible clinicians, ACOs and ACO participants face similar disincentives.
 
Current and future initiatives related to health care technology, data sharing and interoperability may require changes to our operations, impose new and complex compliance obligations and require investments in infrastructure. In particular, AI is driving innovation and, in some cases, augmenting risks related to health care technology. For example, our physicians are adopting the use of generative AI to assist with the taking of patient medical notes, among other tasks. Rapid changes in technology driven by AI may require us to expend significant resources to acquire, develop, implement and maintain that technology. Failure to integrate these technologies in a timely, cost-efficient and resource-efficient manner may impede our ability to deliver health care services in a competitive manner. There is also a risk that our confidential information becomes part of a model that is accessible by other third-party AI applications or users as a result of a cybersecurity incident or a third-party AI developer’s violation of our vendor engagement terms.
The development of AI technologies is complex, and there are technical challenges associated with achieving the desired level of accuracy, efficiency and reliability. For instance, AI models used by us or third-party vendors may be based on biased or deficient datasets, which could result in inaccurate or misleading outputs. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by us or third-party developers or vendors, including any disruptions or failures of AI systems once implemented, could result in unintended consequences. Should the use of AI technologies fail to operate as anticipated or not perform as specified, including any biases or errors in the outputs of AI, patient care may be affected, legal claims may be asserted against us and our reputation may be harmed. Further, federal and state requirements regarding the use of AI by health care providers continue to evolve. For example, HHS finalized a rule in December 2023 imposing transparency requirements for AI and other predictive algorithms that are part of certified health information technology. Some states have adopted or are considering additional measures regarding the use of AI within the health care industry. For example, AB 3030 requires that certain disclaimers and instructions be provided to patients if generative AI is used to create patient communications pertaining to patient clinical information. In addition, the AIPA requires that physicians, nurses and other regulated health care providers disclose when an individual is interacting with generative AI while receiving the regulated service. Further, the CAIA will impose significant requirements on companies that use AI systems to recommend certain health decisions. If we or our third-party providers are restricted from using AI as a result of any laws or regulations, it could impact our operations and cause us to incur costs to replace or modify our use of AI. We may be subject to financial penalties or other disincentives or experience reputational damage for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, any failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party providers to comply with applicable AI laws and regulations could result in investigations or legal proceedings, which could result in significant legal costs and potential liability.
 
We may not be adequately reimbursed by third-party payers for services involving new technology.
As health care technology continues to advance, the price of purchasing new technology has significantly increased for providers. Some payers have not adapted their payment systems to adequately cover the cost of new technology used to treat patients. If reimbursement from third-party payers for services involving new technology does not sufficiently cover our purchasing costs, we may be unable to acquire new technology. Even without sufficient third-party reimbursement, we may acquire or utilize new technology in order to treat our patients. In either case, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.
 
Risks related to public health crises:
The emergence and effects related to a potential future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could adversely affect our business and operations.
 
As a front-line provider of health care services, we are subject to the health and economic effects of public health conditions.
 
If a pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to occur in an area in which we operate, our operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in health care
 

37

 
facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or are treating (or have treated) patients affected by infectious diseases. If any of our facilities are involved, or perceived as being involved, in treating patients from such an infectious disease, other patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities, and our reputation may be negatively affected. Patient volumes may decline or volumes of uninsured and underinsured patients may increase, depending on the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic, epidemic or outbreak. Further, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak might adversely affect our operations by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, causing disruption or delays in supply chains for materials and products or causing staffing shortages in our facilities. Although we have contingency plans in place, including infection control and disaster plans, the potential impact of, as well as the public’s and the government’s response to, a future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Risks related to governmental regulation and other legal matters:
 
Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes and uncertainty in the health care industry, including health care public policy developments and other changes to laws and regulations. We are unable to predict whether, what, and when changes in the health care industry may occur, and the effects and ultimate impact of any changes are uncertain
 
and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 
The health care industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. Regulatory uncertainty has increased as a result of decisions issued by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2024 that affect review of federal agency actions. These decisions increase judicial scrutiny of agency authority, shift greater responsibility for statutory interpretation to courts, expand the time period during which a plaintiff can sue regulators, and may result in inconsistent judicial interpretations and delays in agency rulemaking processes. In 
Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo
, the Court overruled a legal framework that gave significant judicial deference to federal agency interpretations of federal statutes. The Court held that courts must instead exercise independent judgment when deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority and that courts may not defer to an agency interpretation simply because a statute is ambiguous. The 
Loper Bright 
decision and other recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court could have significant impacts on government agency regulation, particularly within the heavily regulated health care industry, and may have broad implications for our business. While the effects of these decisions will become apparent over the coming months and years, we anticipate an increase in legal challenges to health care regulations and agency guidance and decisions, including, but not limited to, those issued by HHS and its agencies, including CMS, the FDA and the OIG. Federal agencies oversee, regulate and otherwise affect many aspects of our business, including through Medicare and Medicaid payment and coverage policies, policies affecting the size of the uninsured population, administration of state Medicaid programs and enforcement and interpretation of fraud and abuse laws. Impacts of the recent Supreme Court decisions could require us to make changes to our operations and have a material negative impact on our business.
 
The health care industry has been and continues to be impacted by health care reform efforts. For example, the Affordable Care Act affects how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed, and expanded health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. Changes in the law’s implementation, subsequent legislation and regulations, state initiatives and other factors have affected and may continue to affect the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased, and may impact our payer mix. Reductions in the number of insured individuals or the scope of insurance coverage, or an increase in patients covered under governmental health programs or other health plans with lower reimbursement levels, may have an adverse effect on our business. For example, the ARPA temporarily enhanced premium tax credits available for purchasing coverage through the Exchanges by lowering premiums and raising income eligibility thresholds. Subsequent legislation extended these enhanced premium tax credits through 2025. However, further extension is uncertain, and we believe the expiration of these enhanced premium tax credits would adversely impact Exchange enrollment and significantly increase the uninsured rate. Other legislative and executive branch initiatives related to health insurance, such as permitting the sale of insurance plans that lack currently required consumer protections, could increase rates of uninsured and underinsured individuals and destabilize insurance markets.
 
In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to change, including as a result of changes from the 2024 federal election. For example, some members of Congress have proposed changes intended to accelerate the shift from traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage, repealing the Affordable Care Act or eliminating some of its consumer protections. The outcome of the 2024 federal election increases regulatory uncertainty. Changes in governmental administration, including changes in agency structures and staffing, such as reduction or elimination of personnel and agencies, may result in changes to established rulemaking conventions and timelines, including for regularly issued reimbursement rules, among other effects. Legislation and administrative actions at the federal level may also impact funding for, or the structure of, the Medicaid program and may shape administration of the Medicaid program at the state level. Changes to the federal funding formula for Medicaid could significantly impact states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, especially if federal contributions for Medicaid expansion populations decrease and states are unable to offset the reductions. Further, some states have trigger laws that would end their Medicaid expansion or
 

38

 
require other changes if federal funding is reduced. CMS may make changes to Medicaid payment models and grant states additional flexibility in the administration of state Medicaid programs, including by allowing additional states to condition Medicaid enrollment on work or other community engagement or permitting other eligibility restrictions. Other health reform initiatives and proposals at the federal and state levels include those focused on price transparency and out-of-network charges, which may impact prices, our relationships with patients, payers or ancillary providers (such as anesthesiologists, radiologists and pathologists) and our competitive position, and site-neutral payment policies, which may reduce the reimbursement we receive. Some states are considering or have imposed rate-setting measures, including limits on hospital rates. Other industry participants, such as private payers and large employer groups and their affiliates, may also introduce financial or delivery system reforms.
There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and what other public policy initiatives will be adopted by federal and state governments and/or the private sector, the timing and implementation of any such efforts and the impact of those efforts on providers and other health care industry participants. These may include changes to trade policy and new or increased tariffs, which may impact our supply chain operations. It is difficult to predict the nature and/or success of current and future public policy changes, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.
 
Changes in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues and business.
 
A significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, we derived 44.5% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2024. However, federal and state governments have made, and continue to make, significant modifications to the Medicare and Medicaid programs through statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings and other interpretations and determinations. These changes may include, for example, reductions to reimbursement levels and to supplemental payment programs, funding restrictions, limitations on scope of coverage or patient eligibility, and changes affecting utilization review. These and other changes may impact the scale and scope of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, may reduce the reimbursement we receive, may affect the cost of providing services to patients and could otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, delays or issues implementing reimbursement-related rules, including periodic payment updates for government programs, and interruptions in the distribution of governmental funds could have an adverse impact on our business.
 
In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. For example, Congress established automatic spending reductions, referred to as sequestration, under the BCA, resulting in a 2% reduction in Medicare payments that extends through the first eight months of federal fiscal year 2032. These reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by other laws. It is difficult to predict whether, when or what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress, but we anticipate that efforts to address the federal budget deficit will continue to place pressures on government health care programs and that future legislation may include additional Medicare spending reductions.
 
From time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including changes to the inpatient hospital MS-DRG system and other payment systems, which may result in reduced Medicare payments. For example, under a site neutrality policy, clinic visit services provided by off-campus provider-based departments are generally not covered as outpatient department services under the outpatient PPS, but instead are paid at the Physician Fee Schedule rate, which is generally substantially lower than the outpatient PPS rate. Further, to address past changes to the 340B Drug Pricing Program that were invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court, CMS finalized payment reductions under the outpatient PPS. Payment rates were reduced for non-drug services in calendar year 2023, and additional reductions to payments for non-drug item and services will take effect in calendar year 2026 and continue for approximately 16 years. As another example, CMS recently finalized changes to the Medicaid fraction of the Medicare DSH payment formula that will result in lower DSH payments for many hospitals. These payment policies and future changes to payment policies may adversely impact our results of operations, and any potential legal challenges to changes may take years to resolve. Payment policies for different types of providers and for various items and services continue to evolve. Congress and/or CMS may implement further changes to reimbursement for items or services that result in payment reductions for other items or services or that otherwise affect our business and operations.
 
In some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from private third-party payers.
 
In addition, several states in which we operate face budgetary challenges that have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, change patient eligibility requirements, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed
 

39

 
care programs, and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Periods of economic weakness may increase the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures may result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in many states. Further, we may be impacted by developments at the federal and state levels related to Medicaid supplemental payments, which are state payments that are separate from fee-for-service base payments, and SDP arrangements, which allow states to direct certain Medicaid managed plan expenditures. Structural and other changes to these programs could result in such payments being reduced or eliminated, for example if funding for SDP arrangements is diverted from other payment programs, and if we do not satisfy applicable criteria when payments are directed to a specific subset of providers. Further, legislation and administrative actions at the federal level may impact the funding for, or structure of, the Medicaid program, and may shape the administration of the Medicaid program at the state level. Changes to the federal funding formula for Medicaid could have a particularly significant impact on coverage and reimbursement in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, as states might not be able to offset decreases in federal funding for expansion populations. In addition, CMS administrators may make changes to Medicaid payment models and may grant states additional flexibility in the administration of state Medicaid programs, including by allowing states to impose eligibility restrictions such as work and community engagement requirements.
 
Current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes or delays in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes by private third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
 
If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.
 
As a participant in the health care industry, we are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:
 
•
billing and coding for services and properly handling overpayments; 
•
appropriateness and classification of level and setting of care provided, including proper classification of admissions, observation services and outpatient care;
•
certifications of patient eligibility for home health and hospice services; 
•
relationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients; 
•
necessity, appropriateness and adequacy of medical care; 
•
quality of medical equipment and services; 
•
qualifications and supervision of medical and support personnel;
•
patient, workforce and public safety; 
•
the confidentiality, maintenance, interoperability, exchange and security of health-related and personal information and medical records, including data breach, ransomware and identity theft issues; 
•
the provision of services via telehealth, including technological standards and coverage restrictions or other limitations on reimbursement;
•
the development and use of AI and other predictive algorithms, including those used in clinical decision support tools; 
•
screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;
•
restrictions on the provision of medical care, including with respect to reproductive care; 
•
facility and personnel licensure, certification and accreditation and enrollment standards and requirements for participation in government programs; 
•
the manufacture, distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals, controlled substances and medical devices; 
•
debt collection, balance billing and billing for out of network services; 
•
consumer disclosures and price transparency;

40

 
•
communications with patients and consumers; 
•
preparing and filing of cost reports; 
•
operating policies and procedures; 
•
activities regarding competitors; 
•
addition of facilities and services; and 
•
environmental protection, including disposal of regulated materials.
Among these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, EKRA, the federal Stark Law, the FCA, the No Surprises Act and similar state laws. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities, laboratories and employed physicians or who are the recipients of referrals, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be brought under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute.
 
Our financial relationships with physicians who make referrals for designated health services and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex. We do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of the Stark Law and its implementing regulations. Thus, we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.
 
Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a 
qui tam
, or “whistleblower,” suit. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”
 
A variety of state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information. Various states in which we operate have passed privacy laws and regulations that impose restrictive requirements on the use and disclosure of personal information, and many other state and federal privacy laws have been proposed. In many cases, these laws are more restrictive or impose more obligations than, and may not be preempted by, the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, may apply to employees and business contacts in addition to patients, and may be subject to new and varying interpretations by courts and government agencies. The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching and may require us to incur substantial expenses, including costs associated with modifying our data processing practices and policies. Failure to comply with these and any other comprehensive privacy laws passed at the state or federal level may result in regulatory enforcement actions, penalties and damage to our reputation. As a result of our operations in the United Kingdom, we are subject to the UK Data Protection Act, which contains stricter privacy restrictions than laws and regulations in the United States and provides for significant fines in the event of violations. These administrative fines are based on a multi-factored approach. Moreover, rules for data transfers outside of the United Kingdom and European Economic Area are subject to increased regulation, and such regulations are frequently subject to further revision and updated regulator guidance, making necessary compliance measures challenging to ascertain and implement with respect to our United Kingdom operations. We expect that there will continue to be new or modified laws, regulations, regulatory guidance and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions, which could impact our operations and cause us to incur substantial costs.
 
We send short message service, or SMS, text messages to patients. While we obtain consent from these individuals to send text messages, federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants may claim that the notices and disclosures we provide, form of consents we obtain or our SMS texting practices are not adequate or violate applicable law. In addition, we must ensure that our SMS texting practices comply with regulations and agency guidance under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”), a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone calls, faxes and text messages. While we strive to adhere to strict policies and procedures that comply with the TCPA, the
 

41

 
Federal Communications Commission, as the agency that implements and enforces the TCPA, may disagree with our interpretation of the TCPA and subject us to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our SMS texting practices violate the TCPA could subject us to civil penalties and could require us to change some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by patients or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. Moreover, if wireless carriers or their trade associations, which issue guidelines for texting programs, determine that we have violated their guidelines, our ability to engage in texting programs may be curtailed or revoked, which could impact our operations and cause us to incur costs related to implementing a workaround solution.
 
We engage in consumer debt collection for HCA-affiliated hospitals and certain non-affiliated hospitals. We also engage in credit reporting for certain non-affiliated hospitals. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the TCPA restrict the methods that companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts and to report to consumer reporting agencies on the status of those accounts. Many states impose additional limitations or requirements on debt collection and credit reporting practices, and some of those requirements are more stringent than the federal requirements.
 
We are also subject to various international, federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. For example, our health care operations generate medical waste, such as pharmaceuticals, biological materials and disposable medical instruments that must be handled, stored, transported, treated and disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Environmental regulations also may apply when we build new facilities or renovate existing facilities. If we are found not to be in compliance with such laws and regulations, we may be liable for significant investigation and clean-up costs or be subject to enforcement actions by governmental authorities or lawsuits by private plaintiffs. Moreover, any changes in the environmental regulatory framework (including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address changing global weather patterns) could have a material, adverse effect on our business.
 
We are also subject to various federal and state antitrust laws that, for example, restrict exclusive contracting relationships with health care providers, restrict sharing of cost and pricing data, prohibit competitors from taking collective action to set commercial payer reimbursement rates and establish integration requirements for joint ventures to contract with payers. We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities occurring within the United Kingdom.
If we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, which are subject to change, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties, money damages, lapses in reimbursement, the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities, exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties. In addition, different interpretations or enforcement of, or amendments to, these and other laws and regulations in the future could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs, result in interruptions or delays in the availability of systems and/or result in a patient volume decline. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit, a determination that we have violated these or other laws or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations could result in liability, could result in negative publicity and an adverse impact on our reputation and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
 
State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.
 
Some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior approval, often known as a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. The failure to obtain any required CON or other required approval could impair our ability to operate or expand
 

42

 
operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to attract patients and physicians to our facilities and grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
We may incur additional tax liabilities.
 
We are subject to tax in the United States as well as those states and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Changes in tax laws, including increases in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws by taxing authorities, other standard setting bodies or judicial decisions, could increase our tax obligations and have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations.
 
We are also subject to examination by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA Healthcare, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
 
We have been and could become the subject of government investigations, claims and litigation, as well as governmental and commercial payer audits.
 
Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various government agencies. Further, under the FCA, private parties have the right to bring 
qui tam
, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities and/or affiliates have received, and other facilities and/or affiliates may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
 
Government agencies and their agents, such as the MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits of our health care operations. CMS and state Medicaid agencies contract with RACs and other contractors on a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare program, including managed Medicare plans, and the Medicaid programs. RAC denials are appealable. However, the RAC audit and appeals processes can impose a significant administrative burden on providers, and we may experience delays in appealing RAC payment denials. Private third-party payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
 
Should we be found out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
 
We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities, which are costly to defend and may require us to pay significant damages if not covered by insurance.
 
We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. Many of these actions seek large sums of money as damages and involve significant defense costs. We insure a portion of our professional liability risks through our insurance subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims arising out of the operation of our facilities, although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage limits of our insurance policies. Our insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts; however, the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance, or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.
 
Risks related to operations, strategy, demand and competition:
 
Our hospitals and other facilities face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.
 
The health care business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals and health care facilities in the communities we serve provide services similar to those we offer. Trends toward transparency and value-based purchasing may have an impact on our competitive position, ability to obtain and maintain favorable contract terms and patient volumes in ways
 

43

 
that are difficult to predict. On its websites, CMS publicizes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals, home health agencies, hospices and various other types of Medicare-certified facilities submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. Its Care Compare website provides an overall rating that synthesizes various quality measures into a star rating for each hospital, home health agency and hospice, among other provider types. If any of our hospitals or other provider types achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on quality measures or on patient satisfaction surveys, our competitive position could be negatively affected. Further, hospitals are required to publish online a list of their standard charges for all items and services, including gross charges, discounted cash prices and payer-specific and de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges, and must also publish a consumer-friendly list of standard charges for certain “shoppable” services or, alternatively, maintain an online price estimator tool for the shoppable services. HHS also requires health insurers to publish online charges negotiated with providers for health care services, and health insurers must provide online price comparison tools to help individuals get personalized cost estimates for covered items and services. The No Surprises Act imposes additional price transparency requirements, including requiring providers to send uninsured or self-pay patients (in advance of the date of the scheduled item or service or upon request) and health plans (prior to the scheduled date of the item or service) of insured patients a good faith estimate of the expected charges and diagnostic codes. HHS is deferring enforcement of certain requirements of the No Surprises Act applicable to providing estimates for insured individuals and providing estimates to uninsured or self-pay patients that do not include expected charges for co-providers or co-facilities. It is not entirely clear how price transparency requirements will affect consumer behavior, our relationships with payers or our ability to set and negotiate prices, but our competitive position could be negatively affected if our standard charges are higher or are perceived to be higher than the charges of our competitors.
 
The number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased. Many individuals are seeking a broader range of services at outpatient facilities as a result of the growing availability of stand-alone outpatient health care facilities, the increase in payer reimbursement policies that restrict inpatient coverage and the increase in the services that can be provided on an outpatient basis, including high margin services. Consequently, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment, which may put pressure on our pricing, ability to contract with third-party payers and strategy for volume growth. Some of the facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician-owned or are owned by governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions or tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. Recent consolidations of not-for-profit hospital entities may intensify this competitive pressure. There is also increasing consolidation in the third-party payer industry, including vertical integration efforts among third-party payers and health care providers, and increasing efforts by payers to influence or direct the patient’s choice of provider by the use of narrow networks or other strategies. Health care industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models. Other industry participants, such as large employer groups and their affiliates and large retail chains, may intensify competitive pressure and affect the industry in ways that are difficult to predict.
 
Our hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with freestanding ASCs and other outpatient providers for market share in certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If ASCs and other outpatient providers are better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in operating margin. In states that do not require a CON or other type of approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities or services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. Some states that have historically imposed CON or similar prior approval requirements have removed or are considering removing these requirements, which may reduce barriers to entry and increase competition in our service areas. Changes in licensure or other regulations and recognition of new provider types or payment models could also impact our competitive position. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, make capital expenditures and maintain modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain more favorable third-party payer contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and other providers, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”
 
Any increase in the volume of uninsured patients or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of operations.
 
The primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary third-party payer has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. At December 31, 2024, estimated implicit price concessions of $7.773 billion had been recorded to adjust our revenues and accounts receivable to the estimated amounts we expect to collect. The estimated cost of total uncompensated care was $4.366 billion for 2024, $3.720 billion for 2023 and $3.491 billion for 2022.
 

44

 
Any increase in the volume of uninsured patients or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and self-pay accounts receivable could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our facilities may experience growth in total uncompensated care as a result of a number of factors, including conditions impacting the overall economy and unemployment levels. In addition, federal and state legislatures have in recent years considered or passed various proposals impacting the size of the uninsured or underinsured population. For example, the ARPA temporarily enhanced premium tax credits available for purchasing coverage through the Exchanges by lowering premiums and raising income eligibility thresholds. These premium tax credits were extended through 2025. However, further extension is uncertain, and we believe their expiration would adversely impact Exchange enrollment and significantly increase the uninsured rate. In addition, under early COVID-19-related legislation, states that maintained continuous Medicaid enrollment were eligible for a temporary increase in federal funds for state Medicaid expenditures. The resumption of redeterminations for Medicaid enrollees in 2023 resulted in significant coverage disruptions and dis-enrollments of Medicaid enrollees, and the number of individuals enrolled in Medicaid declined in 2024 in comparison to 2023. Medicaid enrollment may be further affected by potential changes to the federal funding formula for Medicaid. For example, some states have trigger laws that would end their Medicaid expansion or require other changes if federal funding for expansion populations is reduced. Further, if federal contributions for Medicaid expansion populations decrease, states that expanded Medicaid might not be able to offset such funding reductions. Other legislative and executive branch initiatives related to health insurance, such as permitting the sale of insurance plans that lack currently required consumer protections, could also increase rates of uninsured and underinsured individuals. It is difficult to predict what, whether, and when legislative and regulatory changes may be made in the future.
 
We provide uninsured discounts and charity care for individuals, including for those residing in states that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion or that modify the terms of the program, for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in an Exchange plan or government health care programs and for certain others who may not have insurance. Some patients may choose to enroll in lower cost Medicaid plans or other health insurance plans with lower reimbursement levels. We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of health plan structures that shift greater payment responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts. Further, our ability to collect patient responsibility accounts may be limited by statutory, regulatory and investigatory initiatives, including private lawsuits directed at hospital charges and collection practices for uninsured and underinsured patients. For example, the No Surprises Act requires providers to send uninsured and self-pay patients a good faith estimate of expected charges for items and services. The estimate must cover items and services that are reasonably expected to be provided together with the primary item or services, including those that may be provided by other providers. If the uninsured or self-pay patient receives a bill that exceeds the good faith estimate by an amount deemed to be substantial by regulation (which is currently $400) or the provider furnishes an item or service that was not included in the good faith estimate, they may initiate a patient-provider dispute resolution process established by regulation.
If our volume of patients with private health insurance coverage declines or we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans, our revenues may be adversely affected.
 
Our ability to maintain or increase patient volumes covered by private third-party payers and to maintain and obtain favorable contracts with private third-party payers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our facilities. Revenues derived from private third-party payers (domestic only) accounted for 49.5%, 49.0% and 48.3% of our revenues for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Private third-party payers, including HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, typically reimburse health care providers at a higher rate than Medicare, Medicaid, other government health care programs or uninsured, self-pay patients. If we experience reductions in the volume of patients with private health insurance coverage, our revenues may be reduced. Factors that may cause enrollment in private health insurance to decrease include economic factors, such as increased unemployment and underemployment rates and inflationary pressures, and legislative or regulatory changes that increase barriers to and costs associated with obtaining or maintaining comprehensive coverage, including changes affecting insurance brokers and Exchange navigators, limiting automatic re-enrollment in plans purchased through the Exchanges, or expanding short-term insurance options.
Reimbursement rates are set forth by contract when our facilities are in-network, and payers utilize plan structures to encourage or require the use of in-network providers. Private third-party payers, including managed care plans and payers participating in the Exchanges, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the ongoing trend toward consolidation among payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Payers may utilize plan structures such as narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices, impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier or otherwise shift greater financial
 

45

 
responsibility for care to individuals. Legislative and regulatory initiatives may accelerate or otherwise impact these trends. Cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates, such as directly contracting with a limited number of providers, may also limit our ability to negotiate favorable terms in our contracts and otherwise intensify competitive pressure.
Our ability to retain and renew our third-party payer contracts and enter into new contracts on terms favorable to us may be impacted by other health care providers. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care plans to contract with us. Further, shifts in the payer contracts held by our competitors may impact our patient mix, which could negatively impact our revenues.
 
Trends toward greater price transparency may also negatively impact our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with payers. For example, hospitals are required to publish online payer-specific and de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges. In addition, health insurers are required to provide online price comparison tools to help individuals get personalized cost estimates for covered items and services. In addition, alignment efforts between third-party payers and health care providers and transparency requirements provide payers with increased access to performance and pricing data, which may increase payer bargaining power.
If we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with third-party payers or experience reductions in payment increases or amounts received from third-party payers or the number of patients with private health insurance coverage, our revenues may be reduced.
 
Changes to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies and other factors outside our control that impact demand for medical services may reduce our revenues.
 
Volume, admission and case-mix trends may be impacted by factors beyond our control, such as changes in volume of certain high acuity services, variations in the prevalence and severity of outbreaks of influenza and other illnesses and medical conditions, seasonal and severe weather conditions, changes in treatment regimens and medical technology and other advances. Further, trends in physician treatment protocols and health plan design, such as health plans that shift increased costs and accountability for care to patients, could reduce our surgical volumes and admissions in favor of lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies or result in patients seeking care from other providers. Additionally, our operations may be impacted by expansion of in-home acute care models, and our inpatient volumes may decline if various inpatient hospital procedures become eligible for reimbursement by Medicare when performed in outpatient settings. These and other factors beyond our control may reduce the demand for services we offer and decrease the reimbursement that we receive, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
Third-party payer controls designed to reduce costs and other payer practices intended to decrease inpatient services, surgical procedure volumes or reimbursement for services rendered may reduce our revenues.
 
Controls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid and private third-party payers designed to reduce admissions, intensity of services, surgical procedure volumes and lengths of stay, in some instances referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to increasingly affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by third-party payers and may involve prior authorization requirements. The Medicare program also issues national or local coverage determinations that restrict the circumstances under which Medicare pays for certain services. Inpatient and outpatient service utilization and inpatient occupancy rates and average lengths of stay continue to be negatively affected by third-party payers’ prior authorization requirements, coverage restrictions, utilization review and by pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Cost control efforts have resulted in an increase in reimbursement denials and delays by both governmental and commercial payers, which may decrease the reimbursement we receive and may increase our costs and administrative burden, as additional resources are devoted to collection and documentation efforts. Additionally, the reimbursement we receive may decline as a result of site-neutrality initiatives, which aim to align payment for services across care settings. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue and may have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses, encounter challenges integrating the operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and/or become liable for unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions.
 
A component of our business strategy is acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses. We may encounter difficulty acquiring new facilities or other businesses due to a lack of attractive opportunities or as a result of competition from other purchasers that may be willing to pay purchase prices that are higher than we believe are reasonable. Antitrust

enforcement in the health care industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ, including with respect to hospital and physician practice acquisitions. States also are increasingly enacting laws modeled after the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, requiring pre-notification of covered transactions. These laws may specifically target health care transactions and may have broad impacts on closing timetables and approvals. Some states require CONs in order to acquire a hospital or other facility, or to expand facilities or services. In addition, the acquisition of health care facilities often involves licensure approvals or reviews and complex change of ownership processes for Medicare and other payers. Further, many states have laws that restrict the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws may require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification of the attorney general or other regulators and community involvement. Attorneys general in states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions involving the sale of not-for-profits under their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. These legislative and administrative efforts often focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-profit seller and may include consideration of commitments for capital improvements and charity care by the purchaser. Similarly, some states require disclosures by certain health care entities, including hospitals and physician practices, to state attorneys general or other designated entities in advance of sales or other transactions. Also, the increasingly challenging regulatory and enforcement environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire health care businesses if they are found to have material unresolved compliance issues, such as repayment obligations. Resolving compliance issues as well as completion of oversight, review or approval processes could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals or other businesses and increase our acquisition costs.
 
We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that we acquire with our ongoing operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures and systems. Hospitals and other health care businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with health care and other laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities, workers’ compensation liabilities and tax liabilities. Although we typically exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations, experience liability in excess of any indemnification obtained or otherwise incur material liabilities for the pre-acquisition conduct of acquired businesses. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could harm our business and results of operations.
 
Our facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, public health, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states.
 
We operated 190 hospitals at December 31, 2024, and 100 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented 52% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. This geographic concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, public health, environmental and competitive conditions in those states. Any material changes in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, public health, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a significant and disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
 
Our business and operations are subject to risks related to changing global weather patterns.
 
Changing global weather patterns present both immediate and long-term physical risks (such as potential increases in the intensity or frequency of hurricanes, extreme weather conditions or other natural disasters) and risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy (such as regulatory or technology changes). These changes could result in, for example, temporary declines in the number of patients seeking our services, closures of our hospitals and related facilities, supply chain disruptions, increased costs of products, commodities and energy (including utilities) and disruptions in our information systems, which in turn could negatively impact our business and results of operations. In addition, our hospitals and other facilities in Florida, Texas and other coastal states are located in regions that may be impacted by hurricanes. In the past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals and other facilities in Florida, Texas and other coastal states and the patient populations in those states, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which made landfall in September and October 2024, respectively. Changing global weather patterns could also increase the intensity or frequency of hurricanes, extreme weather conditions or other natural disasters. Our business assets and activities and the communities we serve have been and could in the future be harmed by a particularly active hurricane season or even a single storm. We face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our hospitals and related facilities and business interruptions caused by such events. We maintain property insurance coverage for claims in excess of deductibles and self-insured retention levels generally at $110 million per occurrence to address the impact of physical damage to our facilities and for business interruption losses. However, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover our losses in excess of what we self-insure, and we may experience a material, adverse effect on our results of operations that is not recoverable through our insurance policies. Additionally, if we experience a significant
 

47

 
increase in climate-related events that result in material losses we may be unable to obtain similar levels of property insurance coverage in the future.
In addition, changes in consumer preferences and legislation and regulatory requirements regarding sustainability matters, including those associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy, may increase costs associated with compliance, the operation of our facilities and supplies. Sustainability-related laws and regulations, including those limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may also increase in coming years, which may adversely impact us through increased compliance costs for us and our suppliers and vendors. Our stakeholders may have differing expectations regarding sustainability matters, and certain stakeholders may not be satisfied or agree with our efforts which may result in reputational harm. Additionally, the varied timing of sustainability-related laws and regulations and disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions could complicate our compliance efforts. Our response to changing global weather patterns, our related strategies, policies, objectives, commitments and disclosure, our ability to achieve our climate-related and other sustainability objectives and commitments (which are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control) and/or any perception that our response is ineffective or inefficient, or conversely, not in the best interests of the Company could result in reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence.
The industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.
 
There is a trend toward value-based purchasing of health care services across the health care industry among both governmental and commercial payers. Generally, value-based purchasing initiatives tie payment to the quality and efficiency of care. For example, Medicare requires hospitals, ASCs, home health agencies, hospices and other providers to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called “never events”) or care related to HACs, and federal law prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat HACs. The 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC scores in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments in the applicable federal fiscal year.
 
Hospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated by CMS receive a reduction in their inpatient PPS operating Medicare payments for all Medicare inpatient discharges in the federal fiscal year, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% of a hospital’s base payments.
 
CMS has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 2% in each federal fiscal year. CMS pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by CMS. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement (relative to the hospital’s own past performance). Hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise.
 
In the post-acute care space, home health agencies participate in the nationwide HHVBP Model. Under the model, home health agencies receive increases or reductions to their Medicare fee-for-service payments of up to 5%, based on performance against specific quality measures relative to the performance of other home health providers. Data collected in each performance year affects Medicare payments two years later.
CMS has developed several alternative payment models that are intended to reduce costs and improve quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. Examples of alternative payment models include bundled payment models in which, depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS. Generally, participation in bundled payment programs is voluntary, but CMS required hospitals in selected markets to participate in a bundled payment initiative for specified orthopedic procedures, which ended December 31, 2024. Hospitals in selected markets will be required to participate in a new model focused on five specified surgical episodes beginning January 2026. CMS has indicated that it is evaluating the development of more voluntary and mandatory bundled payment models. Participation in mandatory or voluntary demonstration projects, particularly demonstrations with the potential to affect payment, may negatively impact our results of operations.
 
In a strategic report issued in 2021 and updated in 2022, the CMS Innovation Center highlighted the need to accelerate the movement to value-based care and drive broader system transformation. By 2030, the CMS Innovation Center aims to have all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries and the vast majority of Medicaid beneficiaries in an accountable care relationship with providers who are responsible for quality and total medical costs. The CMS Innovation Center signaled its intent to streamline its payment models and to increase provider participation through implementation of more mandatory models.
 

48

 
There are also several state-driven value-based care initiatives. For example, some states have aligned quality metrics across payers through legislation or regulation. CMS has signaled its intent to support value-based initiatives in the Medicaid context. For example, a final rule issued in May 2024 reduces state burdens for implementing some SDP arrangements, with the intent of helping states use such arrangements to implement value-based initiatives. In addition, private third-party payers are also transitioning toward alternative payment models or implementing other value-based care strategies. For example, many large private third-party payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several private third-party payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events.
 
We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. It is unclear whether these and other alternative payment models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease aggregate reimbursement. We are unable to predict our future payments or whether we will be subject to payment reductions under these programs or how this trend will affect our results of operations. If we are unable to meet or exceed the quality performance standards under any applicable value-based purchasing program, perform at a level below the outcomes demonstrated by our competitors, or otherwise fail to effectively provide or coordinate the efficient delivery of quality health care services, our reputation in the industry may be negatively impacted, we may receive reduced reimbursement amounts and we may owe repayments to payers, causing our revenues to decline.
 
Risks related to macroeconomic conditions:
 
Our overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness or recessions.
 
Our business is impacted by economic conditions in the United States, including periods of significant inflation, higher interest rates or economic weakness or recessions. Also, budget deficits at the federal level and within some state and local government entities have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on spending for health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant third-party payer sources for our hospitals. We anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures and the aging and health status trends of the U.S. population will continue to place pressure on government health care programs, and it is possible that future deficit reduction legislation will mandate additional Medicare spending reductions. There is uncertainty regarding the impact of any failure to increase the “debt ceiling,” and any U.S. government default on its debt could have broad macroeconomic effects. Further, any shutdown of the federal government, failure to enact annual appropriations, hold on congressionally authorized spending or interruptions in the distribution of governmental funds could adversely affect our financial results.
Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), which may lead to poorer health and higher acuity interventions, potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and further difficulties in collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible receivables. Further, inflationary pressures may increase operating expenses to a greater degree and faster than reflected in updates to the reimbursement systems of governmental and private payers. General economic conditions, including inflation, when worsening or remaining volatile for an extended period of time, have and may continue to have, a negative impact on our results of operations, liquidity, ability to repay our outstanding debt and trading price of our common stock. These factors may affect the availability, terms or timing on which we may obtain any additional funding and our ability to access our cash. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in the market values of securities and interest rates.
 
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investment securities held by our insurance subsidiaries were $657 million at December 31, 2024. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses related to factors other than credit loss allowances being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2024, we had net unrealized losses of $27 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.
 
We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investment securities of our insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on long-term
 

49

 
investments in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors.
 
We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates that impact the amount of the interest expense we incur with respect to our floating rate obligations as well as the value of certain investments. We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. These interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates.
 
Risks related to ownership of our common stock:
 
There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends.
 
The Company declares a regular quarterly cash dividend under our cash dividend program. During 2024, the Board of Directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.66 per share, or $2.64 per share in the aggregate, on our common stock. On January 23, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.72 per share on our common stock payable on March 31, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2025.
 
The declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash flows from operations, our available capital and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets as well as our results of operations, financial condition and other factors beyond our control that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or suspension or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.
 
Certain of our investors may continue to have influence over us.
 
On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. and certain other investors. Through their investment in Hercules Holding II and other holdings, certain of the Frist-affiliated investors continue to hold a significant interest in our outstanding common stock (approximately 28% as of January 31, 2025). In addition, pursuant to a stockholders' agreement we entered into with Hercules Holding II and the Frist-affiliated investors, certain representatives of these investors have the continued right to nominate certain of the members of our Board of Directors. As a result, certain of these investors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into corporate transactions (and the terms thereof) and prevent changes in the composition of our Board of Directors or any transaction that requires stockholder approval.

Item 1C. 
Cybersecurity
Management is responsible for the day-to-day handling of risks facing our Company, while the Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, oversees risk management, including cybersecurity risks.
 
The Board has delegated certain risk management responsibilities with respect to cybersecurity to our Audit and Compliance Committee.
 
The Audit and Compliance Committee periodically reviews our data security programs, including cybersecurity processes and procedures regarding cybersecurity threats, AI, disaster recovery and critical business continuity, and reviews our programs and plans that management has established to monitor compliance with data security compliance programs and test emergency operations preparedness. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives reports regarding risks associated with our data security programs and management’s plans for monitoring and testing compliance with data security regulations.
 
The Audit and Compliance Committee meetings take place on a quarterly basis and include a report from our 
Chief Security Officer ("CSO")
 regarding our security programs, including (i) the status on activities under way to support our security strategy, (ii) an overview of the current threat landscape, including emerging threats and trends that may affect us, (iii) key performance measures of security operations and (iv) general security program needs.
 The security program includes cybersecurity and information security risk management. 
Our senior security leadership team has an average of 20 years of data security experience, and each member has served in multiple roles within our security programs.

50

 
We seek to leverage a comprehensive risk management program aligned with the National Institute of Technology Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 that encompasses a structured approach to assess, identify, and manage cyber and information security risks. The internal processes for these activities are evaluated for alignment with our objectives and overall risk tolerance. This approach is consistent with our overall risk management efforts. 
The CSO participates with other senior officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal and Administrative Officer, Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and others on our risk management committee, which develops and coordinates enterprise cybersecurity and information security policy and strategy, and provides guidance to senior management.
 
We utilize cross-functional teams and risk assessment tools and technologies to identify potential cybersecurity and information security threats and risks. These teams include representatives from various departments within our Company to promote a holistic view of the organization
’
s cybersecurity and information security risk landscape and to facilitate communication. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We also seek to embed security measures into software and system development processes and to use current security technologies. 
In addition, we engage third parties to actively monitor potential threats as well as our security defenses.
 The risk landscape is assessed to determine the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks. This assessment involves a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses to help prioritize identified risks and determine the appropriate risk treatment. 
The effectiveness of the cybersecurity and information security program is tested through a combination of internal and external assessments. Updates are provided to senior management and the Audit and Compliance Committee for informed decision-making and are 
integrated
 into our broader enterprise risk management processes.
 
We also seek to oversee and identify potential cybersecurity and information security threats and risks relating to suppliers and third-party service providers. These efforts may include due diligence to assess the party
’
s cybersecurity practices, controls, and compliance with relevant statutes and regulations; the use of contractual agreements that outline certain cybersecurity requirements; and using outside services to perform ongoing monitoring of select suppliers and third-party service providers.
 We also collaborate with select third-party suppliers to develop and align incident response plans.
No risks from cybersecurity threats or previous cybersecurity incidents have materially affected our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
 However, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures in place to monitor and mitigate the risks of cybersecurity threats, including the remediation of critical information security and software vulnerabilities, will be sufficient and/or timely and that we will not suffer material losses or consequences in the future.
 Additionally, while we have in place insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all insured losses or all types of claims that may arise

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above table, we directly or indirectly operate 124 ASCs and 26 freestanding endoscopy centers. We also operate medical office buildings in conjunction with some of our hospitals. These office buildings are primarily occupied by physicians who practice at our hospitals. Twelve of our general, acute care hospitals and five of our other properties have been mortgaged to support our obligations under our senior secured cash flow credit facility.
 
We maintain our headquarters in approximately 2,031,000 square feet of space in the Nashville, Tennessee area. In addition to the headquarters in Nashville, we maintain regional service centers related to our shared services initiatives. These service centers are located in markets in which we operate hospitals.
 
We believe our headquarters, hospitals and other facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are, in general, adequate for our present needs. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating their operation. Management does not believe that compliance with such statutes and ordinances will materially affect our financial position or results of operations.

2024 Operations Summary
 
Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $5.760 billion, or $22.00 per diluted share, for 2024, compared to $5.242 billion, or $18.97 per diluted share, for 2023. The 2024 results include gains on sales of facilities of $14 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. The 2024 results also include additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $250 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, related to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which impacted our facilities in North Carolina and certain facilities in Florida. The 2023 results include losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Our provisions for income taxes for 2024 and 2023 include tax benefits of $102 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, and $93 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 261.806 million shares and 276.412 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 17.798 million and 14.465 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.
 
Revenues increased to $70.603 billion for 2024 from $64.968 billion for 2023. Revenues increased 8.7% and 7.9%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2024, compared to 2023. The consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 5.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. The same facility revenues increase resulted primarily from the combined impact of a 4.5% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. Our revenues from Medicaid state directed and supplemental payment programs totaled approximately $4.9 billion and $3.9 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.
During 2024, consolidated admissions increased 5.0% and same facility admissions increased 4.9%, compared to 2023. Inpatient surgical volumes increased 2.2% on both a consolidated basis and a same facility basis during 2024, compared to 2023. Outpatient surgical volumes declined 1.9% on a consolidated basis and declined 1.6% on a same facility basis during 2024, compared to 2023. Emergency room visits increased 4.8% on a consolidated basis and increased 4.9% on a same facility basis during 2024, compared to 2023.
 
The estimated cost of total uncompensated care increased $646 million for 2024, compared to 2023. Consolidated and same facility uninsured admissions increased 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, and consolidated and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 13.8% and 13.5%, respectively, for 2024, compared to 2023.
 
Interest expense totaled $2.061 billion for 2024, compared to $1.938 billion for 2023. The $123 million increase in interest expense for 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the average debt balance.
 
Cash flows from operating activities increased $1.083 billion, from $9.431 billion for 2023 to $10.514 billion for 2024. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was related primarily to an increase in net income of $542 million, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities, and a positive change in working capital items of $351 million, mainly from a decline in inventories and other assets.
Business Strategy
 
We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, convenient and cost-effective health care while growing our business and creating long-term value for our stockholders. We strive to be the health care system of choice in the communities we serve by developing comprehensive networks locally and supporting these networks with enterprise expertise and economies of scale. Our strategy is organized around a framework that seeks to drive sustained growth by delivering operational excellence, attracting exceptional physicians and other health care professionals, developing comprehensive services, creating greater access, and coordinating higher quality care for patients. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:
 
Grow Our Presence in Existing Markets.
 We believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. We plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and developing comprehensive service lines such as cardiology, neurology, oncology, orthopedics and women’s services. Additional components of our growth strategy include providing access and convenience through developing various outpatient facilities, including, but not limited to surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency care facilities, imaging centers and home health and hospice services, as well as seeking to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets.

Business Strategy (continued)
Achieve Industry-Leading Performance in Clinical, Operational and Satisfaction Measures.
 Achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business. To achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. We routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. We believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.
 
Recruit and Retain Physicians and Other Health Care Professionals to Meet the Need for High Quality Health Services.
 We depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. We believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other health care professionals to provide high quality care. We attract and retain physicians and other health care professionals by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. We believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians and other health care professionals will improve the quality of care at our facilities.
 
Continue to Utilize Economies of Scale to Grow the Company.
 We believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our company by fully utilizing the scale and scope of our organization. We continue to invest in initiatives such as care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. We believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. We continue to invest in our shared service platforms to deploy key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.
 
Pursue a Disciplined Development Strategy.
 We continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. We will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market opportunities. To complement our in-market growth agenda and achieve cost savings and other benefits for the patients and communities we serve, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers.
 
Our strategy also emphasizes investments that seek to advance our clinical systems and digital capabilities, transform care models with innovative care solutions, expand our workforce development programs and enhance our health care networks and partnerships.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)
Revenues
 
Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding management’s interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. We have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed standardized calculation processes and related employee training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.
 
Patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care who have income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for charity care, and we limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. Patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care who have income above 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for certain other discounts which limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. We apply additional discounts to limit patient responsibility for certain emergency services. The federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. We may provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance, or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
 
Implicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Estimated implicit price concessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the age of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been performed. The estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated implicit price concession amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to the valuations of our accounts receivable or period-to-period comparisons of our revenues.
 
To quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured patient accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view total uncompensated care, which is comprised of charity care, uninsured discounts and implicit price concessions. A summary of the estimated cost of total uncompensated care for the years ended December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

Revenues (continued)
Management expects a continuation of the challenges related to collection of patient due accounts. Adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations. See Item 1, “Business — Developments in Health Care Public Policy.”
 
Professional Liability Claims
 
We, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. Our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to $80 million per occurrence ($110 million effective January 1, 2025), subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of either $25 million or $35 million per occurrence, depending on the jurisdiction for the related claim. We purchase excess insurance on an occurrence reported basis for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $627 million, $619 million and $517 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We recorded an increase to the provision for professional liability risks of $40 million during 2023 and a reduction to the provision for professional liability risks of $55 million for 2022, due to the receipt of updated actuarial information.
 
Reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. Individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. Once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. Several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. These methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. Company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. This company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.
 
Reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. The estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.855 billion to $2.221 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.863 billion to $2.230 billion at December 31, 2023. Our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. Based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. We consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. A 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $31 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $30 million. A 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $121 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $113 million. We believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.

Professional Liability Claims (continued)
The reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,100 individual claims at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 and estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. The average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately five years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this average. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.
 
Reserves for professional liability risks were $2.131 billion and $2.089 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The current portion of these reserves, $587 million and $532 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of $80 million and $42 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively) were $2.051 billion and $2.047 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are comprised of $1.059 billion and $947 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $992 million and $1.100 billion, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims. The 2024 increase in case reserves for known claims and the corresponding decrease in reserves for incurred but not reported claims is the result of changes in case management processes at our insurance subsidiary that include establishing case reserve estimates earlier and resolving claims quicker.
 
Changes in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

Income Taxes
 
We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods. Interest and penalties payable to taxing authorities are included as a component of our provision for income taxes. We have elected to treat taxes incurred on global intangible low-taxed income as a period expense.
 
Although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. Significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. During each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. If the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. Final audit results may vary from our estimates.

Revenue/Volume Trends
 
Our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
 
Revenues increased 8.7% to $70.603 billion for 2024 from $64.968 billion for 2023 and increased 7.9% for 2023 from $60.233 billion for 2022. The increase in revenues in 2024 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 5.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues in 2023 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 4.9% increase in equivalent admissions and a 2.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission compared to the prior year.
Same facility revenues increased 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 and increased 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The 7.9% increase for 2024 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 4.5% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. The 7.6% increase for 2023 can be primarily attributed to the net impact of a 4.8% increase in equivalent admissions and a 2.7% decline in revenue per equivalent admission.
Consolidated admissions increased 5.0% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 2.7% during 2023 compared to 2022. Consolidated inpatient surgical volumes increased 2.2% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 1.3% during 2023 compared to 2022. Consolidated outpatient surgical volumes declined 1.9% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 2.1% during 2023 compared to 2022. Consolidated emergency room visits increased 4.8% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 4.1% during 2023 compared to 2022.
 
Same facility admissions increased 4.9% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 3.3% during 2023 compared to 2022. Same facility inpatient surgical volumes increased 2.2% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 2.0% during 2023 compared to 2022. Same facility outpatient surgical volumes declined 1.6% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 2.5% during 2023 compared to 2022. Same facility emergency room visits increased 4.9% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 4.7% during 2023 compared to 2022.
 
Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 13.5% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 1.0% during 2024 compared to 2023. Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.4% and same facility uninsured admissions declined 0.4% during 2023 compared to 2022.
 
The approximate percentages of our admissions related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid, managed care and insurers and the uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are set forth below.

At December 31, 2024, we owned and operated 46 hospitals and 28 surgery centers in the state of Florida. Our Florida facilities’ revenues totaled $16.600 billion, $14.990 billion and $13.753 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2024, we owned and operated 54 hospitals and 40 surgery centers in the state of Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled $19.832 billion, $17.871 billion and $16.472 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, 59%, 58% and 58%, respectively, of our admissions and 52%, 51% and 50%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our Florida and Texas facilities. Uninsured admissions in Florida and Texas represented 74%, 73% and 74%, respectively, of our uninsured admissions during 2024, 2023 and 2022.
 
We receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Some state Medicaid programs use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement Medicaid expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. We receive supplemental payments in several states. These supplemental payment programs are regularly reviewed by certain government agencies and some states have made requests to CMS to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. In May 2024, CMS issued a final rule related to Medicaid managed care programs that addresses access, financing and quality within these programs. This final rule addresses aspects of state directed program arrangements with new and updated requirements to ensure a more consistent and transparent approach for participating states. The various elements of the rule take effect between issuance and early 2028. It is possible that these developments, reviews and requests will result in the restructuring of or other significant changes to supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. Because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications and other program changes, if any, may have on our results of operations.
 
Key Performance Indicators
We present certain metrics and statistical information that management uses when assessing our results of operations. We believe this information is useful to investors as it provides insight to how management evaluates operational performance and trends between reporting periods. Information on how these metrics and statistical information are defined is provided in the following tables summarizing operating results and operating data.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
 
Results of Operations (continued)
Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
 
Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $5.760 billion, or $22.00 per diluted share, for 2024, compared to $5.242 billion, or $18.97 per diluted share, for 2023. The 2024 results include gains on sales of facilities of $14 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. The 2024 results also include additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $250 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, related to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which impacted our facilities in North Carolina and certain facilities in Florida. The 2023 results include losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Our provisions for income taxes for 2024 and 2023 include tax benefits of $102 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, and $93 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 261.806 million shares and 276.412 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 17.798 million and 14.465 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.
 
During 2024, consolidated admissions increased 5.0% and same facility admissions increased 4.9% compared to 2023. Consolidated and same facility inpatient surgeries each increased 2.2% during 2024 compared to 2023. Emergency room visits increased 4.8% on a consolidated basis and increased 4.9% on a same facility basis during 2024 compared to 2023.
 
Revenues increased 8.7% to $70.603 billion for 2024 from $64.968 billion for 2023. The increase in revenues was due primarily to the combined impact of a 5.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission compared to 2023. Same facility revenues increased 7.9% due primarily to the combined impact of a 4.5% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission compared to 2023. Our revenues from Medicaid state directed and supplemental payment programs totaled approximately $4.9 billion and $3.9 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 44.1% in 2024 and 45.4% in 2023. Salaries and benefits per equivalent admission increased 0.4% in 2024 compared to 2023. Same facility salaries and benefits per full time equivalent increased 1.8% for 2024 compared to 2023. We continue to utilize certain contract, overtime and other premium rate labor costs to support our clinical staff and patients. While these costs have declined compared to the prior year period, future costs may be affected by labor market conditions and other factors. Share-based compensation expense was $360 million in 2024 and $262 million in 2023.
Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 15.2% in both 2024 and 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 3.1% in 2024 compared to 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 5.6% for medical devices and 3.2% for general medical and surgical items, but declined 2.4% for pharmacy supplies in 2024 compared to 2023.
 
Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 21.0% in 2024 and 19.8% in 2023. Other operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. The 1.2% increase in other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues for 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily related to increased costs for state provider fees in certain states, professional fees and repairs and maintenance, primarily related to remediation activities in certain hospitals in the state of Florida in response to Hurricane Milton. We have seen inflation have a negative impact on certain of these expenses and expect inflationary pressures will continue to impact operating expenses in 2025. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $627 million and $619 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded an increase of $40 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, during 2023 to our provision for professional liability risks related to the receipt of updated actuarial information.
 
Equity in earnings of affiliates was $23 million for 2024 and $22 million for 2023.
 
Depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenues, were 4.7% in both 2024 and 2023. Depreciation expense was $3.294 billion for 2024 and $3.052 billion for 2023. The increase of $242 million in depreciation expense relates primarily to capital expenditures at our existing facilities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
 
Results of Operations (continued)
Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (continued)
Interest expense increased to $2.061 billion for 2024 from $1.938 billion for 2023. The $123 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average debt balance. The average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 5.0% for both 2024 and 2023. Our average debt balance was $41.388 billion for 2024 compared to $38.790 billion for 2023.
Gains on sales of facilities were $14 million for 2024 and losses on sales of facilities were $5 million for 2023.
The effective income tax rate was 24.5% for 2024 and 23.6% for 2023. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships.
 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $849 million for 2023 to $897 million for 2024. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to the operations of one of our Texas markets and our surgery center partnerships.
