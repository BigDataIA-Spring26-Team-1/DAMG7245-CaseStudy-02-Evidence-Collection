Risks related to our indebtedness:

•
We have significant indebtedness and may incur further indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations. 
•
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. 
•
Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. 
Risks related to human capital:

•
Our results of operations may be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and other health care professionals and labor union activity. 
•
Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians. 
•
We may be unable to attract, hire and retain a highly qualified workforce, including key management.

Risks related to technology, data privacy and cybersecurity:

•
Cybersecurity incidents or other forms of data breaches could result in the compromise of our facilities, confidential data or critical data systems, causing our operations to be impaired or impacted. A cybersecurity incid

Risks related to operations, strategy, demand and competition:

•
Our hospitals and other facilities face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers. 
•
Any increase in the volume of uninsured patients or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of operations. 
•
If our volume of patients with private health insurance coverage declines or we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans, our revenues may be adversely affected. 
•
Changes to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies and other factors outside our control that impact demand for medical services may reduce our revenues. 
•
Third-party payer controls designed to reduce costs and other payer practices intended to decrease inpatient services, surgical procedure volumes or reimbursement for services rendered may reduce our revenues.
•
We may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses, encounter challenges integrating the operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and/or become liable for unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions. 
•
Our facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, public health, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states.

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying low-income individuals. Payment under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is conditioned on satisfaction of extensive provider enrollment requirements. All of our general, acute care hospitals located in the United States are eligible and enrolled to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established hospital gross charges for the services provided.

Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of health care services, including private health insurers, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”) and other managed care plans, including health plans offered through the Exchanges. These discount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.” For services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, patients are generally responsible for any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amounts of such exclusi

MS-DRG payment rates are updated, and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated, using cost-relative weights each federal fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index used to update the MS-DRG payment rates (the “market basket”) gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services. Each federal fiscal year, the annual market basket update is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. A decrease in payment rates or an increase in rates that is below the increase in our costs may adversely affect our results of operations.

For federal fiscal year 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) increased the MS-DRG payment rates by approximately 3.1%. This increase reflected a market basket update of 3.3%, reduced by a 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2025, CMS increased the MS-DRG payment rates by approximately 2.9%. This increase reflects a market basket update of 3.4%, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. Additional adjustments may apply, depending on patient-specific or hospital-specific factors. For example, the two-midnight rule limits payments to hospitals when services to Medicare beneficiaries are payable as inpatient services. In addition, under transfer policies, Medicare reimbursement rates may be red

Further, Medicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG if certain designated hospital acquired conditions (“HACs”) were not present on admission and the identified HAC is the only condition resulting in the assignment of the higher paying MS-DRG. In this situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. There are currently 14 categories of conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC scores in the designated performance period receive a 1.0% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments in the applicable federal fiscal year. CMS has also established three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis.

Under the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, payments to hospitals may also be reduced based on readmission rates. Each federal fiscal year, inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences “excess” readmissions within the 30-day time period from the date of discharge for conditions or procedures designated by CMS during the prior performance review period. CMS has designated six conditions or procedures under the program, including heart attack, pneumonia and total hip arthroplasty. Hospitals with what CMS defines as excess readmissions for these conditions or procedures receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges i

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit. A payment rate is established for each APC and updated for each calendar year. Each calendar year, the annual market basket update is further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2024, CMS increased payment rates under the outpatient PPS by an estimated 3.1%. This increase reflected a market basket increase of 3.3%, reduced by a 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2025, CMS increased payment rates by an estimated 2.9%. This increase reflects a market basket increase of 3.4%, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. CMS requires hospitals to submit quality data relating to outpatient care to avoid receiving a 2.0 percentage point reduction in the annual payment update under the outpatient PPS.

Medicare reimbursement for outpatient services may also be affected by broad shifts in payment policy. For example, the 340B Drug Pricing Program allows participating h

Medicare reimbursement for outpatient services may also be affected by broad shifts in payment policy. For example, the 340B Drug Pricing Program allows participating hospitals to purchase certain outpatient drugs from manufacturers at discounted rates. These hospitals are reimbursed for the discounted drugs under the same Medicare payment methodology and rates that apply to non-340B hospitals. In 2018, CMS implemented a payment policy that reduced Medicare payments for 340B hospitals for most drugs obtained at 340B-discounted rates and that resulted in increased payments for non-340B hospitals. Most of our facilities are non-340B hospitals. In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated this 340B program payment policy. In light of this U.S. Supreme Court decision and to achieve budget neutrality, CMS reduced payment rates for non-drug services under the outpatient PPS for calendar year 2023, and lump sum payments were distributed to affected 340B hospitals as the remedy for calendar years 2018 through 2022. In order to comply with budget neutrality requirements, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) finalized a corresponding offset in future non-drug item and service payments for all outpatient PPS providers (except new providers) that will reduce the outpatient PPS conversion factor by 0.5% annually. This adjustment will start in calendar year 2026 and continue for approximately 16 years.
In addition, CMS has implemented an expanded site-neutral paymen

Psychiatric

Inpatient hospital services furnished in behavioral hospitals and behavioral units of general, acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals are reimbursed on a PPS basis. The inpatient psychiatric facility (“IPF”) PPS is based upon a per diem payment, with adjustments to account for certain patient and facility characteristics. The IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a facility’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral. Each federal fiscal year, IPF payment rates are updated using a market basket index, which is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2024, CMS increased IPF payment rates by an estimated 3.3%, which reflected a 3.5% IPF market basket increase with a negative 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2025, CMS increased the IPF payment rates by 2.8%, which reflects a 3.3% IPF market basket increase, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. Together with other policy changes, total Medicare payments to IPFs are anticipated to increase by 2.5% in federal fiscal year 2025. Inpatient psychiatric facilities are required to report quality measures to CMS to avoid receiving a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket u
