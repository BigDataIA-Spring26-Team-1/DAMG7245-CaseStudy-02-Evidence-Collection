Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OTHER MATTERS

Information related to legal proceedings appears in Note 14 – "Environmental and legal matters" of Part I, Item 1 “Financial Statements.”
Retirement Benefits
We recognize 
mark-to-market gains and losses
 immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. We will record the annual mark-to-market adjustment as of the measurement date, December 31, 2025. It is difficult to predict the December 31, 2025 adjustment amount, as it will be dependent primarily on changes in discount rates during 2025, and actual returns on plan assets differing from our expected returns for 2025.

Order Backlog
At the end of the third quarter of 2025, the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $39.8 billion, about $2.4 billion higher than the second quarter of 2025 due to increases in the Energy & Transportation segment. Of the total backlog at September 30, 2025, approximately $12.5 billion was not expected to be filled in the following twelve months.

We believe it is important to separately disclose our annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for our results to be meaningful to our readers. The annual effective tax rate is discussed using non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of amounts associated with discrete items recorded fully in the quarter they occur. These items consist of (i) the increase in the annual effective tax rate in 2025, (ii) the impact of changes in estimates related to prior years (iii) the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense and (iv) restructuring costs related to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities in 2024. We believe the non-GAAP measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing the company's period-over-period results.
