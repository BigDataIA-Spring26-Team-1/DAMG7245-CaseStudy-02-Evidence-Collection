2024 COMPARED WITH 2023 
CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2023 (at left) and 2024 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees.
Total sales and revenues for 2024 were $64.809 billion, a decrease of $2.251 billion, or 3 percent, compared with $67.060 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales volume of $3.543 billion, partially offset by favorable price realization of $1.238 billion. The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by lower sales of equipment to end users. In addition, changes in dealer inventories had an unfavorable impact to sales volume. Dealer inventory increased less during 2024 than during 2023.
In the three primary segments, sales were lower in Construction Industries and Resource Industries and higher in Energy & Transportation.
North America sales decreased 1 percent primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization. The decrease in sales volume was mainly due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventory increased less during 2024 than during 2023.
Sales increased 1 percent in Latin America. Unfavorable currency impacts related to the Brazilian real were more than offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. The increase in sales volume was primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventory increased during 2024, compared to a decrease during 2023.
EAME sales decreased 10 percent primarily due lower sales volume. The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by lower sales of equipment to end users. 
Asia/Pacific sales decreased 6 percent primarily due to lower sales volume. The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventory decreased in 2024, compared to an increase in 2023.
Total dealer inventory increased about $400 million during 2024, compared to an increase of about $2.1 billion during 2023. Machine dealer inventory decreased about $700 million during 2024, compared to an increase of $700 million during 2023. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. We do not expect a significant change in machine dealer inventories in 2025.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2023 (at left) and 2024 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes 
consolidating adjustments
 and 
Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses
.
Operating profit was $13.072 billion in 2024, an increase of $106 million, or 1 percent, compared with $12.966 billion in 2023. The profit impact of lower sales volume of $1.298 billion, higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses of $201 million, and higher restructuring costs of $165 million were more than offset by favorable price realization of $1.238 billion, the absence of the impact of the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023 of $586 million and favorable manufacturing costs of $246 million. The increase in SG&A/R&D expenses was primarily driven by investments aligned with strategic initiatives. Favorable manufacturing costs largely reflected lower freight. 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, restructuring costs increased primarily due to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities.
Operating profit margin was 20.2 percent in 2024, compared with 19.3 percent in 2023.

The effective tax rate for 2024 was 19.7 percent compared to 21.3 percent for 2023. Excluding the discrete items discussed below, the annual effective tax rate was 22.2 percent for 2024 compared to 21.4 percent for 2023. The increase from 2023 was primarily related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective.
In 2024, the company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $224 million for a tax law change related to currency translation. The 2024 annual effective tax rate excludes the impact of losses of $164 million for the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities with related tax benefits of $54 million. The 2023 annual effective tax rate excludes the impact of the nondeductible loss of $586 million related to the divestiture of the company’s Longwall business. The company also recorded a tax charge of $43 million related to $154 million of mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans in 2024, compared to a tax charge of $26 million related to $97 million of mark-to-market gains in 2023. In 2024, the company recorded discrete tax benefits of $47 million to reflect changes in estimates related to prior years. In addition, a discrete tax benefit of $57 million was recorded in 2024 and 2023 for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. In 2023, the company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $88 million due to a change in the valuation allowance for certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets.

Financial Products Segment
Financial Products’ segment revenues were $4.053 billion in 2024, an increase of $268 million, or 7 percent, compared with $3.785 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a favorable impact from higher average financing rates across all regions of $153 million and a favorable impact from higher average 
earning assets
 of $127 million driven by North America.
Financial Products’ segment profit was $932 million in 2024, an increase of $23 million, or 3 percent, compared with $909 million in 2023. The increase was mainly due to a favorable impact from higher average earning assets of $54 million, an insurance settlement of $33 million, and a favorable impact from equity securities of $32 million. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses of $54 million and an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment of $34 million.
Corporate Items and Eliminations
