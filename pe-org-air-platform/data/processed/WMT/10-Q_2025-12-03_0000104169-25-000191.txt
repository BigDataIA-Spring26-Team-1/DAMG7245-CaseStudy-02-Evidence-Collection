Item 1A. Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption "Risk Factors," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended October 31, 2025 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of October 31, 2025, authorization for $5.1 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, its results of operations and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was as follows:

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific U.S. economic sanctions during the reporting period.
As previously disclosed, the Company has identified transactions in South Africa between Builders, which specializes in retail home improvement and construction materials and is a division of its subsidiary Massmart Retail (Pty) Ltd. ("Massmart"), and a customer that appears to be the Embassy of Iran in Pretoria, South Africa (the "Embassy"). In August 2025, the Company had multiple ordinary retail sales transactions to the Embassy of general construction materials valued at approximately $85. 
During a review of Massmart business customers following discovery of the above transactions, the Company also identified transactions between Makro, a separate division of Massmart, and an individual apparently purchasing on behalf of the Embassy.
 
From April 2019 through October 1, 2025, the Company had multiple ordinary retail sales transactions with this individual valued at approximately $74,000, including approximately $3,500 during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2025. 
We are unable to accurately calculate the net profit attributable to these sales transactions, but it would be significantly less than the gross sales amount. The Company does not plan to continue selling to the Embassy or this individual.
