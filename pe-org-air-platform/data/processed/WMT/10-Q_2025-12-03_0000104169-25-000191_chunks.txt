Item 1A. Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption "Risk Factors," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

From April 2019 through October 1, 2025, the Company had multiple ordinary retail sales transactions with this individual valued at approximately $74,000, including approximately $3,500 during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2025. 
We are unable to accurately calculate the net profit attributable to these sales transactions, but it would be significantly less than the gross sales amount. The Company does not plan to continue selling to the Embassy or this individual.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, upda
