Iran threat reduction disclosure
Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure may be required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Except as set forth below, as of the date of this report, the Firm is not aware of any other activity, transaction or dealing by any of its affiliates during the quarter ended September 30, 2025 that requires disclosure under Section 219.
During the third quarter of 2025, the Firm determined that an existing account holder at a non-U.S. subsidiary of the Firm had previously become employed by a subsidiary of an entity which is owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. The account was valued at the equivalent of approximately USD 119,000. The Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiary charged fees of the equivalent of approximately USD 850 from the time the account holder became employed by the applicable entity through the third quarter of 2025. The Firm has closed the account.
The Firm does not intend to engage in such transactions in the future.
