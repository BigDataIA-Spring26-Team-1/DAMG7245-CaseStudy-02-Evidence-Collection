In the table above, total shares purchased included 75 shares during July 2025 remitted to satisfy statutory withholding taxes related to share-based awards.
During the first quarter of 2025, our Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing repurchases of up to $40 billion of our common stock. This program replaced our previous share repurchase program and has no set expiration or termination date. The share repurchases are effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position, and capital deployment oppo

Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K.
These statements may relate to, among other things, (i) our future plans and results, including our target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, CET1 capital ratio and firmwide total credit alternative assets, and how they can be achieved, (ii) trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses, including the timing, costs, profitability, benefits and other aspects of business and strategic initiatives, such as OneGS 3.0, and their impact on our efficiency ratio, (iii) the opportunities and challenges presented by AI, (iv) our Investment banking fees backlog and future advisory and capital markets results, (v) expenses we may incur, including the level of future compensation expense, (vi) the projected growth of our deposits and other funding, (vii) our business and expense savings initiatives, (viii) our planned benchmark debt issuances, (ix) our credit exposures, (x) our expected provision for credit losses and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, (xi) the narrowing of our consumer business, (xii) the objectives and effectiveness of our BCP, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, (xiii) our resolution plan and its implications for stakeholders, (xiv) the effect of changes to regulations, and our future status, activities or reporting under banking and financial regulation, (xv) our expected tax rate, (xvi) the future state of our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios, and our prospective capital distributi

anges in investment preferences and changes in economic or market conditions. 
Statements about the timing, costs, profitability, benefits and other aspects of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share and the narrowing of our consumer business are based on our current expectations regarding our ability to implement these initiatives, and actual results may differ, possibly materially, from our current expectations due to, among other things, a delay in the timing of these initiatives, increased competition and an inability to reduce expenses and grow businesses with more durable revenues or to exit certain consumer businesses. 
Statements about expenses we may incur, our level of future compensation expense, including as a percentage of both operating expenses and net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, and our efficiency ratio are subject to the risks that the compensation and other costs to operate our businesses may be greater than currently expected. 
Statements about our Investment banking fees backlog and future advisory and capital market results are subject to the risk that advisory and capital market activity may not increase as we expect or that such transactions may be modified or may not be completed at all, and related net revenues may not be realized or may be materially less than expected. Important factors that could have such a result include, for underwriting transact

Statements about the future state of our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios (including our SCB and G-SIB surcharge), and our prospective capital distributions (including dividends and repurchases), are subject to the risk that our actual liquidity, regulatory capital ratios and capital distributions may differ, possibly materially, from what is currently expected due to, among other things, the need to use capital to support clients, increased regulatory requirements resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations, results of applicable supervisory stress tests, changes to the composition of our balance sheet and our results of operations. Statements about the estimated impact of proposed, but not finalized, capital rules are subject to change as the proposed rules may change, the final rules may differ from the proposed rules and our balance sheet composition will change. As a consequence, we may underestimate the actual impact of the final rules.
Statements about the risk exposure related to the asset recovery guarantee provided to the Government of Malaysia are subject to the risk that

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages. We have estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for matters where we have been able to estimate a range and we believe, based on currently available information, that the results of matters where we have not been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but may be material to our operating results in a given period. Given the range of litigation and investigations presently under way, our litigation expenses may remain high. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Use of Estimates” in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for information about our reasonably possible aggregate loss estimate and judicial, regulatory a
