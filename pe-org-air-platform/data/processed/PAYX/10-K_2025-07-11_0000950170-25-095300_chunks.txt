Seasonality
 
There is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement solutions clients, and new worksite employees associated with our HR Outsourcing businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many businesses prefer to start using our solutions at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to year-end bonus payments, additional year-end services, and the preparation and delivery of end-of year reporting requirements.
