Item 1A in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2025 and other SEC filings, we may need to adjust our capital, operating and other discretionary spending to realign our working capital requirements with the capital resources available to us. Furthermore, if we determine the need for additional short-term liquidity, there is no assurance that such financing, if pursued and obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.

Letters of credit:
 As of November 30, 2025, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling $172.9 million, primarily to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between December 01, 2025 and February 28, 2027. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during the second quarter or as of November 30, 2025.

Long-term financing:
 We have borrowed $0.8 billion through the issuance of long-term private placement debt (“Senior Notes”) and $4.2 billion through the issuance of three fixed rate corporate bonds ("Corporate Bonds"). The following is information on each of our long-term financing arrangements related to future cash commitments:

We also maintain corporate insurance coverage, in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies, for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism, as well as capacity for deductibles and self-insured retention through our captive insurance company.
Operating, Investing, and Financing Cash Flow Activities
Primary sources of cash, restricted cash, and equivalents are through collections for services rendered to our customers and interest earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. Primary uses of cash include employee compensation and contractual obligations related to business operations, cash dividends paid, share repurchases, purchases of property and equipment, long-term debt service, and acquisitions.

Our investment portfolio incorporates both corporate cash and funds held for clients. Interest rates, market conditions, and our variable cash flows are among several factors influencing our investment strategy directing the mix between long-term and VRDN AFS securities vs. short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents held in the portfolio. A portfolio strategy that favors larger balances held in restricted cash and cash equivalents may impact our investing activities due to the offsetting activity in the purchases and sales/maturities of AFS investments.
Our cash flows include certain activities that are short-term in nature and have an impact

Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:
 Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and AFS securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of AFS securities. As a result of our investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our long-term AFS securities. We follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. A substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of AA or higher, and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities. We invest predominantly in corporate bonds; municipal bonds; U.S. government agency securities; and VRDNs when available in the market. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We manage the AFS securities to a benchmark duration of two to three and one-quarter years.

During the six months, our primary short-term investment vehicles were U.S. government agency discount notes and bank demand deposit accounts. We have no exposure to high-risk or non-liquid investments. We have insignificant exposure to European investments.

During the six months, the average interest rate ea

•
daily interest rate changes;
•
seasonal variations in investment balances;
•
actual duration of short-term and AFS securities; 
•
the proportion of taxable and tax-exempt investments;
•
changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous; and
•
financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates.

Subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 19 basis points. Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to earnings from a 25-basis-point change in short-term interest rates would be approximately $5.5 million to $6.0 million, after taxes, for a twelve-month period. Such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the Federal Funds rate.

Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investments) is expected to average approximately $7.4 billion for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2026. Our anticipated allocation is approximately 40% invested in short-term securities and VRDNs with an average duration of less than 30 days and 60% invested in AFS securities, with an average duration of two to three and one-quarter years.

The combined funds held for clients and corporate AFS secur

We are also exposed to interest rate risk through the use of our recurring credit facilities as outlined in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Form 10-Q. If interest rates were to increase, or we increase the frequency or amounts borrowed under these credit facilities, we could experience additional interest expense and a corresponding decrease in earnings.

Credit risk:
 We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our investments in AFS securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns and we believe that the investments we held as of November 30, 2025 were not impaired as a result of the previously discussed reasons. While $1.9 billion of our AFS securities had fair values that were below amortized cost, we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms, and that the gross unrealized losses of $42.1 million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns. A substantial portion of the AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as of November 30, 2025 and May 31, 2025 had an AA rating or better. We do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity, and further believe that it is not mor

Item 7 of our Form 10-K for fiscal 2025, filed with the SEC on July 11, 2025. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the critical accounting policies and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including, but not limited to, those related to:

•
revenue recognition;

assets recognized from the costs to obtain and fulfill contracts;
•
PEO insurance reserves;
•
goodwill and other intangible assets;
•
impairment of long-lived assets; 
•
stock-based compensation costs; 
•
business combinations; and
•
income taxes.

There have been no material changes in these aforementioned critical accounting policies and estimates.
