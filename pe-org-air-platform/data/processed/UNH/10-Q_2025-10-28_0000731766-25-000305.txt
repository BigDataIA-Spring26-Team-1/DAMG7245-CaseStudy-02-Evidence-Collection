ITEM 2.    UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board of Directors evaluates periodically. In June 2024, the Board of Directors amended our share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 35 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured repurchase programs), in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board’s 2018 renewal of the program. There is no established expiration date for the program. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program.
There were no repurchases of the Company’s common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had 21 million shares remaining available under its share repurchase authorization.
