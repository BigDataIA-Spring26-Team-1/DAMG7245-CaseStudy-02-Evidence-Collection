ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2024 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2024 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. 
There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2024 10-K.
ITEM 2.    UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board of Directors evaluates periodically. In June 2024, the Board of Directors amended our share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 35 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured repurchase programs), in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board’s 2018 renewal of the program. There is no established expiration date for the program. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program.
There were no repurchases of the Company’s common stock
