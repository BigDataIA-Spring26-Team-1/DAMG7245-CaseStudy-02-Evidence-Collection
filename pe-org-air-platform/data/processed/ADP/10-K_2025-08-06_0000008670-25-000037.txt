Item 1A. Risk Factors”, and in other written or oral statements made from time to time by ADP, should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate and organic constant currency are all non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
As a global leader in HR and payroll solutions, ADP continuously aims to solve complex business challenges for our clients and their workers. Our Human Capital Management ("HCM") solutions, which include both software and outsourcing services, are designed to help our clients manage their workforce through a dynamic business and regulatory landscape and the changing world of work. We see tremendous opportunity ahead as we focus on our three key Strategic Priorities: Leading with Best-in-Class HCM technology, Providing Unmatched Expertise and Outsourcing Solutions, and Leveraging our Global Scale for the Benefit of our Clients. 
During fiscal 2025, we continued to make meaningful progress on our Strategic Priorities. We launched ADP Lyric HCM, an all-in-one solution designed to address workplace challenges with personalized experiences that meet client needs. We acquired WorkForce Software, a premier workforce management solutions provider, and began to integrate it into our global HCM ecosystem to better serve large, global enterprises. We enhanced our distribution network by launching an integrated payroll solution for small businesses. We augmented our global payroll capabilities by continuing to expand our offerings in markets with exciting growth opportunities like Japan and Saudi Arabia, and by acquiring payroll businesses like PEI (Procesamiento Externo de Informacion, S.C.) in Mexico. Lastly, we continued deploying AI tools in our products and across our sales, service, and research and development functions to improve the client experience and drive internal productivity gains. 
Highlights from the year ended June 30, 2025 include:
•
Revenue growth of 7% to $20,560.9 million; 7% growth on an organic constant currency
•
Earnings before income taxes margin expansion of 50 bps, and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 bps 
•
Diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share ("EPS") growth of 10% and 9%, respectively, to $9.98 and $10.01, respectively
•
Cash returned via shareholder friendly actions of $3.7B, including $2.4B of dividends and $1.3B of share repurchases
For fiscal 2025, we delivered strong revenue growth of 7% both on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, grew 1% for the year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. PEO average worksite employees increased 3% for the year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. Additionally, our ES new business bookings grew 3% in fiscal 2025, and ES client revenue retention was 92.1%. Our strong retention stems in part from our company-wide client satisfaction scores reaching new record highs for the year. These impressive client satisfaction results were broad-based and are a testament to the product investments we are making to improve the client experience.
We have a strong business model, generating significant cash flows with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients’ HCM functions. We generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our long term strategy and commitments to shareholder friendly actions. We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate.
 Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2025 and we remain well positioned to support our associates and our clients.

Revenues increased in fiscal 2025 due to new business started from new business bookings, strong client retention, an increase in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, an increase in pricing, an increase in interest on funds held for clients, and the impact from the WorkForce Software acquisition. Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the changes in revenue for each of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services. 
Total revenues for fiscal 2025 include interest on funds held for clients of $1,189.1 million, as compared to $1,024.7 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from an increase in our average interest rate earned to 3.2% in fiscal 2025, as compared to 2.9% in fiscal 2024, coupled with an increase in our average client funds balances of 6.4% to $37.6 billion in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.

Additionally, operating expenses increased by $137.3 million due to higher service and implementation costs in support of our growing revenue and by $67.8 million due to an increase in costs related to workers' compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.
Research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2025 due to increased costs to develop, support, and maintain our new and existing products and the WorkForce Software acquisition.
Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2025 due to the WorkForce Software acquisition, amortization of investments in internally developed software primarily for our next-gen products, and amortization of purchased software, partially offset by lower amortization of customer contracts and lists.
30
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2025 primarily due to increases in selling and marketing expenses of $184.4 million as a result of investments in our sales organization and an increase from acquisition related costs.
Interest expense increased in fiscal 2025 primarily due to an increase of $51.1 million related to commercial paper and reverse repurchase borrowings as a result of increases in 
average daily commercial paper borrowings of 
$0.6 billion, 
and average reverse repurchase outstanding balances of 
$1.1 billion, as 
compared to fiscal 
2024
, 
offset by decreases in average interest rates on commercial paper issuances and reverse repurchases of 50 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, as compared to fiscal 2024. Additionally, interest expense increased by $37.9 million related to the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior notes during the first quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Provision for Income Taxes
The 
effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 
23.2%
 and 23.0%, respectively.
 The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2025 and a valuation allowance release in fiscal 2024 offset by an increase in the excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation in fiscal 2025. Refer to Note 12, Income Taxes, within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes
The adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 23.2% and 23.0%, respectively. The drivers of the adjusted effective tax rate are the same as the drivers of the effective tax rate discussed above.

For fiscal 2025, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS reflect the changes in components described above.

PEO Services' revenues increased in fiscal 2025 due to the increase in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, and an increase in average worksite employees of 3%, as compared to fiscal 2024.
Earnings before Income Taxes
PEO Services’ earnings before income taxes increased in fiscal 2025 due to increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by increases in operating costs related to workers' compensation and state unemployment insurance, zero-margin benefits pass-through costs, and selling and marketing expenses.
Margin
PEO Services' margin decreased in fiscal 2025 due to increases in zero-margin benefits pass-through costs, operating costs related to workers' compensation and state unemployment insurance, and selling and marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in the pre-tax benefit from ADP Indemnity.
ADP Indemnity provides workers’ compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services’ worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance policy that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence and has also secured aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the PEO segment. 
Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), to cover substantially all losses incurred by the Company up to the 
$1 million per occurrence related to the workers
’
 compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees. 
Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. 
During fiscal 2025, 
ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $276 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2025 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence. ADP Indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $10 million in fiscal 2025 and a pre-tax benefit of approximately $3 million in fiscal 2024, which were primarily the results of more favorable actuarial loss development in workers’ compensation reserves. ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $278 million in July 2025, to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for fiscal 2026 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2025 reinsurance policy.
Other
The primary components of “Other” are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and all other interest income and expense.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:

We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior periods, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  The nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.

(a) In adjusted EBIT, we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “All other interest expense” and “All other interest income.”
(b) The charges in fiscal 2024 include consulting costs relating to our company-wide transformation initiatives.
(c) In fiscal 2024, this represents reserve reversal of a legal matter from fiscal 2023.
36
(d) In fiscal 2025, there were $23.9 million of severance charges related to broad-based, company-wide initiatives, including efforts to align resources with respect to our new global HCM products, offset by a $4.6 million partial reversal of the workforce optimization initiative from fiscal 2024. Severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to broad-based, company-wide initiatives.
(e) The income tax (benefit)/provision was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect for the year ended June 30, 2025.
(f) The adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our adjusted net earnings plus our adjusted provision for income taxes.
The following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction. The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year results using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of June 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalent
s
 were $3.3 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.
For corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with our 
$10.6 billion
 of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2025 and we have sufficient liquidity.
For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements 
($7.5 billion of which is available on a committed basis in the U.S. as of June 30, 2025)
, together with our 
$10.6 billion
 of comm
itted credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Please see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a further discussion of the risks related to our client funds extended investment strategy. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.

Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to growth in our business, and net favorable changes in the components of operating assets and liabilities, as compared to fiscal 2024.
Net cash flows used in investing activities changed due to the acquisition of WorkForce Software with a net cash disbursement of 
 
$1,158.3 million and timing of the net proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $523.0 million. 
Net cash flows used in financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $9,288.1 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, a net increase in cash distributed to our clients that was received from the Internal Revenue Service, and a net increase in payments related to reverse repurchase agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance and redemption of debt.
We purchased approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $289.11 during fiscal 2025, as compared to purchases of 5.1 million shares at an average price per share of $244.04 during fiscal 2024. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
 
Capital Resources and Client Fund Obligations
We have $4.0 billion
 of senior unsecured no
tes with maturity dates in 2028, 2030, 2032, and 2034. We may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our senior unsecured notes.
Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $10.6 billion in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by Moody’s and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. As of
 June 30, 2025, the Company had 
$4.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which was 
38
repaid in early July 2025. A
s of 
June 30, 2024, 
the Company had 
no

Our U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. As of June 30, 2025, we had $7.5 billion available to us on a committed basis under the U.S. reverse repurchase agreements. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were $38.4 million and $385.4 million, respectively, of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements.

We vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. We have a $4.6 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2026 with a one-year term-out option. In addition, we have a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2029 and June 2030, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through June 30, 2025 under the credit facilities. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $10.6 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.
Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. We own AAA-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, and device payment plan agreement receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected through June 30, 2025. In addition, we own U.S. government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by Federal Farm Credit Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. See Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.
Capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 were $176.8 million, as compared to $211.7 million in fiscal 2024. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2026 to be between $225.0 million and $250.0 million.
Contractual Obligations
Our contractual obligations at June 30, 2025 relate primarily to operating leases (Note 7) and other arrangements recorded in our balance sheet or disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, including benefit plan obligations (Note 11), liabilities for uncertain tax positions (Note 12), purchase obligations (Note 13), debt obligations (Note 10) and $875.0 million of interest payments on our debt, of which $121.5 million is expected to be paid within one year. 
In addition to the obligations described above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2025, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2026,
 
39
total $31,343.3 million, and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $30,985.7 million of cas
h and cash e
quivalents and marketable securities to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2025.
Separately, ADP Indemnity paid a p
remium of 
$278.0 million
 in July
 2025 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2026 policy year. As of June 30, 2025, ADP Indemnity had total assets of $725.4 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $665.7 million for the policy years since July 1, 2003. ADP Indemnity paid claims of $6.3 million and $1.1 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Refer to the “Analysis of Reportable Segments - PEO Services” above for additional information regarding ADP Indemnity. 
In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities, client employees or other payees).
Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.  
    
We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. In circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities or not reinvest maturing securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client funds obligations. We attempt to minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by generally impounding the client's funds by the time we pay such client’s obligation. When we don't impound client funds in advance of paying such client obligations, we are at risk of not recovering such funds or material delay in such recovery. Through our client funds investment strategy and client impounding processes, we have consistently maintained the required level of liquidity to satisfy all of our obligations.
There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under o
ur 
$10.6 billion
 commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, P-1 by Moody’s, and F1+ by Fitch, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transaction
s ($7.5 billion of which is available on a committed basis in the U.S. as of June 30, 2025), 
and available borrowings under our $10.6 billion committe
d credit facilities. The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
40
We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate, Canadian government agency and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB-rated securities is 5 years, and for single A rated, AA-rated and AAA-rated securities it is 10 years. Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1. Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf.

We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased from 3.0% in fiscal 2024 to 3.2% in fiscal 2025. A hy
pothetical chan
ge in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $24 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2026. A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $8 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2026.
We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA-rated and AA- rated securities, as rated by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, DBRS for Canadian dollar denominated securities, and Fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government, and United Kingdom government securities.
We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Note 1, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other comprehensive income. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. 
The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. These estimates require levels of subjectivity and judgment, which could result in actual results differing from our estimates. The Company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates:
Deferred Costs - Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts
Description
Incremental costs of obtaining a contract (e.g., sales commissions) and cost incurred to implement clients on our solutions (e.g., direct labor) that are expected to be recovered are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the client retention period, depending on the business unit.
Judgments and Uncertainties
The Company has estimated the amortization periods for deferred costs by using its historical client retention rates by business unit to estimate the pattern during which the service transfers. The expected client relationship period ranges from three to eight years.
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
As the assumptions used to estimate the amortization period of the deferred costs could have a material impact on timing of recognition, we assess the amortization periods annually using historical retention rates. Actual retention rates were not materially different than those used in our calculation to determine the amortization period. We regularly review our deferred costs for impairment. There were no impairment losses incurred during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, June 30, 2024, or June 30, 2023.
Goodwill
 
Description
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired.
Judgments and Uncertainties
The Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2025 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates. Several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences. 
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including the weighted-average cost of capital, tax rates, market comparisons, and terminal growth rates. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in material impairments of our goodwill. The assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the Company’s operating strategy. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses.
42
We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of June 30, 2025 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. We performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a one percentage point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital would not result in an impairment of goodwill for all reporting units and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values.
Income Taxes
Description
Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Judgments and Uncertainties
The Company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when computing the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions. 
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
While the Company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, 
which include interest and penalti
es, were $163.0 million and $126.9 million, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
Roseland, New Jersey
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related statements of consolidated earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated 
August 6, 2025
, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Goodwill – Employer Services Reportable Segment— Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company uses the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margin. In addition, the discounted cash flow model requires the Company to select an appropriate weighted average cost of capital based on current market conditions as of June 30, 2025. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.
Forecasts of future revenue and operating margin from the Company’s next-gen platform, for which there is limited historical data, contribute significantly to the estimate of fair value of a reporting unit within the Employer Services reportable segment with approximately $683 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2025. Given the limited historical data associated with the Company’s next-gen platform, significant management judgment was required to forecast future revenue and operating margin to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. In turn, a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort were required when performing 
44
audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of revenue and operating margin and the selection of the weighted average cost of capital, including the involvement of our fair value specialists. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenue and operating margin and the selection of the weighted average cost of capital used by management to estimate the fair value contributed by the next-gen platform included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit within the Employer Services reportable segment, such as controls related to management’s forecasts of future revenue and operating margin and the selection of the weighted average cost of capital.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation models, methodology, and significant assumptions used by the Company, specifically the weighted average cost of capital including:
◦
Testing the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s calculation of the weighted average cost of capital.
◦
Developing a range of independent estimates and compared to the weighted average cost of capital selected by management.
•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and operating margin by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts. Due to the limited historical data for the next-gen platform, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue and operating margin forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) the historical operating results of the Company’s similar existing platforms, (2) the limited operating results to date of the next-gen platform, (3) internal communications to management and the board of directors, and (4) external communications made by management to analysts and investors.
Client Funds Obligations - Refer to Note 5 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Client funds obligations represent the Company's contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy clients' payroll, tax and other payee payment obligations and are recorded as a liability at the time that the Company impounds funds from clients (i.e., money movement). The Company has reported client funds obligations as a current liability in the consolidated financial statements totaling $
31,343.3
 million as of June 30, 2025. This money movement activity involves significant amounts of client funds being impounded and remitted to third parties and results in a high volume of transactions. 
To validate the accuracy and completeness of the client funds obligations reported as of period end, the Company performs complex data extracts in order to reconcile the transactional data to the client funds obligations and funds held for clients balances reported at period end. Given the significant volume of data used in the reconciliation, the complexity of the data extraction, and the reconciliation of the data extracts to the client funds obligations balance reported, auditing the client funds obligations is complex and requires the involvement of data specialists to independently reperform the reconciliation and assist with testing of the completeness and accuracy of client funds obligations reported as of period end, including identifying the manual adjustments identified in management’s reconciliation process. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the Company's client funds obligations included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of general information technology controls over the applications relevant to the money movement reconciliation process.
•
We tested the effectiveness of (1) management’s controls over the client funds obligations data reconciliation and (2) management’s control to reconcile the consolidated client funds obligations to the corresponding consolidated funds held for clients balance.
•
We involved data specialists to (1) independently reperform management’s client funds obligations reconciliation and (2) perform data analyses to identify and evaluate recurring and new adjustments to the data extracts in the current period.
•
For a selection of client funds obligations transactions, we evaluated whether the funds were impounded prior to June 30, 2025, agreed the liability to the corresponding asset balance, and evaluated whether the funds were properly included or excluded from the client funds obligations.
•
We made a selection of adjustments identified by management’s reconciliation of the transactional data to the client funds obligations balance reported at period end and evaluated whether the adjustments were supported and appropriate to reconcile and validate the client funds obligations balance reported at period end.
•
We made a selection of disbursements to third parties subsequent to the balance sheet date to evaluate whether they were properly included or excluded from client funds obligations.
•
We tested the Company’s reconciliation of the consolidated client funds obligations to funds held for clients.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts or where otherwise stated)
NOTE 1. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. 
Basis of Preparation.
 The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its subsidiaries and variable interest entity (“ADP” or the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company has a grantor trust, which holds the majority of the funds provided by its clients pending remittance to employees of those clients, tax authorities, and other payees. The Company is the sole beneficial owner of the trust. The trust meets the criteria in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, “Consolidation” to be characterized as a variable interest entity (“VIE”). The Company has determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the trust because it has both (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust (including the power to make all investment decisions for the trust) and (2) the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trust (in the form of investment returns) and therefore, consolidates the trust. Further information on these funds and the Company’s obligations to remit to its clients’ employees, tax authorities, and other payees is provided in Note 5, “Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.”
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other comprehensive income that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Certain amounts from the comparative financial statements have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year's presentation.
 
B. 
Description of Business. 
The Company is a provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management (“HCM”) solutions. The Company classifies its operations into the following 
two
 reportable segments: Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services. The primary components of the "Other" category include certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, legal settlements, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and interest expense.
C. 
Revenue Recognition. 
Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (
e.g.,
 Employer Services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds, other Employer Services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the Company's solutions. The Company enters into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (
e.g.,
 number of payees). 
The Company enters into service agreements with clients that include anywhere from one service to a full suite of services. The Company’s agreements vary in duration having a legally enforceable term of 
30
 days to 
7
 years. The performance obligations in the agreements are generally combined into one performance obligation, as they are considered a series of distinct services, and are satisfied over time because the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the Company performs the services. The Company uses the output method based on a fixed fee per employee serviced to recognize revenue, as the value to the client of the goods or services transferred to date (e.g., number of payees) appropriately depicts our performance towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. The fees are typically billed in the period in which services are performed. 
PEO, a component of the HR Outsourcing (“HRO”) business, provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers’ compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions. Amounts collected from PEO worksite employers include payroll and payroll taxes, fees for benefits, and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes, fees for workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes. 
The payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers are presented in revenue net, as the Company does not retain risk and acts as an agent with respect to this aspect of the PEO arrangement. With respect to the payroll and payroll taxes, the PEO worksite employer is primarily responsible for providing the service and has discretion in establishing wages.
52
The fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits (i.e., PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs), workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits, workers’ compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses, as the Company does retain risk and acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement. With respect to these fees, the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the service and has discretion in establishing price. 
We recognize client fund interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. 
Set up fees received from certain clients to implement the Company's solutions are considered a material right. Therefore, the Company defers revenue associated with these set up fees and records them over the period in which such clients are expected to benefit from the material right, which is approximately 
five
 to 
seven years
. 
Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive to perform its services typically occurs within 
30
 to 
60
 days of billing. We assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history and their intention to pay the consideration. 
D. Deferred Costs.
 
Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract
Incremental costs of obtaining a contract (e.g., sales commissions) that are expected to be recovered are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 
three
 to 
eight years
, depending on the business unit. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs the Company incurs to obtain a contract that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
Costs to fulfill a Contract
The Company capitalizes costs incurred to fulfill its contracts that i) relate directly to the contract ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy the Company's performance obligations under the contract and iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Costs incurred to implement clients on our solutions (e.g., direct labor) are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected client relationship period if the Company expects to recover those costs. The expected client relationship period ranges from 
three
 to 
eight years
. These costs are included in operating expenses. 
The Company has estimated the amortization periods for the deferred costs by using its historical client retention by business units to estimate the pattern during which the service transfers.
E. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents.
 Highly liquid investment securities with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value.
F. 
Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients.
 All of the Company's marketable securities are considered to be “available-for-sale” and, accordingly, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized. Realize
